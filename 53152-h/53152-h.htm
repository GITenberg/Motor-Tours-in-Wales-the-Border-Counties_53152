<h2><a name="SHORT_RUNS_IN_SHROPSHIRE" id="SHORT_RUNS_IN_SHROPSHIRE">SHORT RUNS IN SHROPSHIRE</a></h2>

<p>There was once a tramp who said&mdash;“Och,
now, it’s true what I’m tellin’
ye; I never got a bit o’ good out o’ me life
till I took to the road!”</p>

<p>He was quite serious about it. He was a
nice tramp, with a fine sense of romance
and a large trust in the future, and on
this first day of the tour his words ring
in my head above the rush of the wind and
the throbbing of the engine. For though
all the days will be good, this first day is
surely the best. To be on the road again;
to have one’s luggage behind one and all
the world in front; to watch the villages
slipping by and mark their changing character;
to saunter through strange towns
and swing across great, desolate moorlands;
to pause at some attractive inn, or eat sand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>wiches
and sunshine by the wayside&mdash;this is
the first day. History and the camera must
wait; the first day must be given up to the
sheer joy of the road.</p>

<p>So, as we shall not be able to hurry in
Shropshire, seeing that there history cannot
be ignored, we shall do well to cross
its border in the evening, and spend the
night in Ludlow. We will drop gently
down the hill by Ludford House, and cross
the Teme when the light is growing dim,
and we can only tell by the deepening of the
shadows in the trees on the left that the
castle stands among them. Then we will
climb a short, steep hill into the town
through the only one of the old gates
that is still standing, turn to the right
through the Bull Ring, and draw up before
the famous carved front of the “Feathers.”</p>

<p class="caption">THE FEATHERS HOTEL, LUDLOW.</p></div>

<p>Here in this little town, in its historic inn,
in its church and its great castle, we may
find the concentrated essence, as it were, of
the glamour of Shropshire&mdash;that borderland
where the local stories have helped to
make the history of England, and the
quiet towns have seen wild deeds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
courage and horror, and the fields have
been red with blood; where every tiny
village has its own tale of love or battle,
of fair lady or fugitive king. This very
house, the “Feathers,” has a world of
romance in its timbered walls and panelled
rooms, for it is far older than the beautiful
Jacobean chimney-piece before which
we shall presently dine. These moulded
ceilings and elaborate carvings, it is said,
were once the property of a member of
that Council of the Welsh Marches that
Edward IV. established to bring order into
the affairs of this stormy neighbourhood,
where the “Lords Marchers” had hitherto
taken what they chose, and kept it if they
could. It is said that the English King
once asked by what warrant the Lords
Marchers held their lands. “By this
warrant,” said one of them grimly, drawing
his sword&mdash;and the inquiry went no
further.</p>

<p>The President of this Council lived in
the great castle that still stands so imposingly
above the Teme, with its outer and
inner baileys, its Norman keep and curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
round chapel, and all its long, long
memories.</p>

<p class="caption">THE ROUND CHAPEL, LUDLOW CASTLE.</p></div>

<p>Within these grey walls we may dream
of many things, both pitiful and gay: of
all the children who have played and the
poets who have written here; of young
Prince Arthur, who died here; of his
bride, Katherine of Arragon; of poor
Princess Mary&mdash;“my ladie Prince’s grace,”
as they called her quaintly&mdash;the Queen of
blood and tears. Edward IV. and his
brother Edmund, dressed in green gowns,
played in these courts as boys, and wrote
a letter to their “right noble lord and
father,” begging him daily to give them
his hearty blessing, and to send them some
fine bonnets by the next sure messenger;
and here on the right is the roofless tower
whose crumbling walls are haunted by the
most touching memories in all Ludlow.
For these weed-grown stones have echoed
to the voices of Edward IV.’s little sons,
who lived and laughed here with no
thought of that grimmer Tower that is
connected for ever with their names. There
is still existing a wonderful letter written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
by the King to “his Castle of Lodelowe,”
in which he gives the most minute instructions
as to the education and general
deportment of the Prince of Wales&mdash;not
forgetting the baby’s bedtime. His Majesty,
indeed, was definite on all points.</p>

<p>“We will that our said son have his
breakfast immediately after his mass; and
between that and his meat to be occupied
in such virtuous learning as his age shall
suffer to receive.”</p>

<p>His age at this time was three years.
Not only was the virtuous learning to
occupy him from breakfast till dinner, but
during the latter meal “such noble stories
as behoveth to a prince to understand and
know” were to be read aloud to him; and
“after his meat, in eschewing of idleness,”
he was to be “occupied about his learning”
again. It is a relief to read that after his
supper he was to have “all such honest disports
as may be conveniently devised for his
recreation.” At eight o’clock his attendants
were “to enforce themselves to make him
merry and joyous towards his bed”; and,
indeed, after so hard a day of virtuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
learning and noble stories and honest disports,
the poor child must have been glad
to get there!</p>

<p>Later on, when Sir Henry Sidney was
President of the Council, this ground
where we are standing was trodden by
his son Philip, the pattern of chivalry,
who “fearde no foe, nor ever fought
a friend”; and it was through that doorway
at the top of the inclined plane&mdash;then
a flight of marble steps&mdash;that little
Lady Alice Egerton, not knowing that she
was on her way to immortality, passed
on the evening that she took part in the
first performance of <i>Comus</i>, which Milton
had written for her.</p>

<p>It is curious that in this venerable town
so many of our thoughts should be claimed
by the very young. Ludlow Castle, as one
sits here thinking of the past, seems to be
peopled with the ghosts of children. And
even in the church whose great tower gives
Ludlow so distinguished an air, the church
where the solemn Councillors of the Marches
have their pompous tombs, we find the grave
of Philip Sidney’s little sister. “Heare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
lyethe the bodye of Ambrozia Sydney,
iiijth doughter of the Right Honourable
Syr Henrye Sydney ... and the Ladye
Mary his wyef.” It is sometimes said, too,
that Prince Arthur, Henry VII.’s young son,
is buried here, but this is not the case.
There is a cenotaph that was, perhaps
raised in his memory, but his body was
taken to Worcester Cathedral.</p>

<p>These are the gentler memories of Ludlow.
Of the fiercer kind there is no lack, from
the old fighting days of the de Lacy who
built the keep, and the de Dinan who built
the round chapel, down through centuries
of siege and battle to the time of the Civil
War, when the King’s flag flew here longer
than on any other castle of Shropshire.</p>

<p>Ludlow might well be chosen as a centre
for motor drives in Herefordshire, Shropshire,
and Worcestershire. But for the
moment we are concerned with Shropshire
only, and the centre of that county, in
every sense, is Shrewsbury; and so, sad
though it is to leave Ludlow so soon, we
must glide away down the steep pitch
beyond the door of the “Feathers,” past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the railway station, past the racecourse,
and over the twenty-nine miles of excellent
and level road that lie between Ludlow and
Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>The first village on this road, Bromfield, is
very typical of the villages of Shropshire at
their best. The black-and-white cottages
seem to have been set in their places with
an eye to pictorial effect; the stream and
bridge are exactly in the right spot; and
to complete the picture, a beautiful old
gatehouse stands a little way back from
the road. It is built half of stone, half of
timber and plaster, and was once the gateway
of a Benedictine Priory which is mentioned
in Domesday Book as being of some
importance. It leads now to the church,
and is one of those unexpected touches of
beauty and interest that may meet one’s
eye at any turn of a Shropshire road.</p>

<p class="caption">STOKESAY CASTLE.</p></div>

<p>At Onibury we cross the line and the
river Onny, and about a mile and a half
further on we should begin to look for
Stokesay Castle on the left. As it is a
little way from the main road, and partly
hidden by trees, it is easy to miss it when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
travelling at a good pace; but it is perhaps
the most attractive ruin in Shropshire from
an artist’s point of view, and should on no
account be neglected. It is really a fortified
house rather than a castle, and the mingling
of the warlike with the domestic gives it a
peculiar charm. The northern end, with
its irregular roof and overhanging upper
storey, the “Solar Room,” with its magnificent
carved chimney-piece, and even the
timbered gateway, are all merely suggestive
of a dwelling-house; and it is only when we
turn to the curious polygonal tower that
we remember how in the old days an
Englishman’s house was either very literally
his castle or was likely to become
some other Englishman’s house at an early
date. As far as I know, however, the only
time that Stokesay had to make any use
of its defences was when it was garrisoned
for the King during the Civil War, and on
that occasion it seems to have yielded
without much ado.</p>

<p>It is by very pleasant ways that this
road is leading us&mdash;between wooded hills
and over quiet streams. The valley narrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and is at its prettiest near Marshbrook and
Little Stretton; then the pointed hill of
Caradoc became conspicuous, and beyond
it the famous Wrekin appears&mdash;famous not
for its beauty, but because, being in the
centre of the county, it can be seen by
nearly every one in Shropshire, and so has
gathered round it the sentiment of all
Salopian hearts. “To friends all round the
Wrekin!” is the famous Shropshire toast,
and there, far away to the right, is the
isolated rounded hill that means so much
to those born within sight of it. At
Stretton we leave the hills and wooded
valleys behind us, and pass through a few
miles of rather dull country. It is at the
village of Bayston Hill that we first see,
dimly blue against a background of hills,
the slender spires&mdash;almost unrivalled in
beauty&mdash;of that fair town which long ago
the Welsh named <i>Y Mwythig</i>, the Delight.</p>

<p>The history of Shrewsbury is stirring, and
very, very long. When England was still
in the making she stood there on her hill,
looking down at the encircling river that
has defended her for so many centuries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Nearly every street is connected in some
way with history; every second house is
haunted by some great name. Many large
and solemn books have been written about
Shrewsbury, and not one of them is dull.
Even in these few hundred yards between
the river and our hotel how many memories
there are! As we turn on to the English
Bridge to cross the Severn we should
glance backwards to the right at the red
tower and great west window of the Abbey
founded by the Conqueror’s kinsman, Roger
de Montgomery, a man of mark; and then,
having crossed the steep rise and fall of the
bridge, we climb into the heart of the town
by the hill called the Wyle Cop. It was
up this steep hill that, not so very long ago,
the London coach used to dash, turning
into the yard of the Lion Hotel at a
pace that is still spoken of with awe and
admiration. If we were to do the like we
should probably have to pay five pounds
and costs, so we will ascend the Cop in a
way more conducive to dreaming of the
past: of Harry Tudor on his way to “trye
hys right” at Bosworth, with the welcom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>ing
citizens strewing flowers before him;
of the more stately procession that wound
up the hill when he came back as Henry VII.
with his Queen and young Prince Arthur;
of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, and his
stepson Essex, after their reception by
bailiffs and aldermen, “and other to the
number of xxiiij scarlet gowns, with the
scollars of the freescoole,” listening wearily
“at the upper end of the Wylde Coppe,”
to three orations! Henry Tudor, when he
reached the Wyle Cop, was glad to take
shelter for the night in that picturesque
little black-and-white house with the overhanging
top storey and the tiled roof&mdash;it
is on the left, rather more than half-way
up the hill&mdash;for he had not won his way
into the town without difficulty. “The
gates weare shutt against him and the portculleys
lett downe,” and a bailiff of the
town&mdash;“a stout, wise gentleman,” we are
told&mdash;vowed that Henry should only enter
over his prostrate body. So, when Henry
had made it clear that he did not mean to
hurt the town, “nor none therein,” the
only way for the stout, wise gentleman to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
keep his word was by lying down on the
ground and allowing his future king to
step over him. Thus did Henry of Richmond
come in triumph to the little house
on the Wyle.</p>

<p>If we are going to the “Raven,” or the
“Crown,” as is probable, we turn to the right
near the top of the hill, and pass the beautiful
old timbered house&mdash;which stands on
the right hand, a little back from the street&mdash;where
Princess Mary stayed on her way
to Ludlow after she had been created
<i>Prince</i> of Wales; and a little further up,
on the left, is the many-gabled house where
Prince Rupert lived for a time when he was
here with Charles I. On each side of us
rises one of the slender spires that are the
pride of Shrewsbury. St. Alkmund’s Church,
on the left, was founded by Alfred’s daughter
Ethelfleda, known as the Lady of the
Mercians; a lady, it would seem, of some
force. “A woman of an enlarged soul,”
William of Malmesbury calls her; and adds:
“This spirited heroine assisted her brother
greatly with her advice, and was of equal
service in building cities.” It is gravely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
recorded in a serious chronicle that in 1533
“the dyvyll apearyd in Saint Alkmond’s
Churche there when the preest was at
highe masse with greate tempest and darknes,
so that as he passyd through the
churche he mountyd up the steeple in the
sayde churche, teringe the wyer of the
sayde clocke, and put the prynt of hys
clawes uppon the iiijth bell.” This steeple
on our left was the very scene of this feat;
but the body of the church was rebuilt in
the eighteenth century. Another old Shrewsbury
church, St. Chad’s, had fallen down,
and the congregation of Saint Alkmund’s
feared a repetition of the disaster. In the
case of St. Alkmund’s, however, it was the
rebuilding that was the disaster.</p>

<p>The story of St. Mary’s lovely spire, on
our right, is full of incident. In 1572 it was
“blown aside by wind”; in 1594 “there fell
such a monstrous dry wind, and so extreme
fierce ... that the like was never seen of
those that be living ... the force whereof
removed the upper part of St. Mary’s
steeple out of his place towards the south
about five inches”; in 1662 the steeple was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
“taken down six yards from the top”; in
1690 it was damaged by an earthquake; in
1754 it was “shattered by a high wind”;
in 1756 the newly-built part was again
“blown aside”; in 1818 the upper part
“became loose”; and during a terrific storm
in 1894 fifty feet of its masonry fell through
the roof of the nave shortly after the
evening service. Most wonderfully this last
disaster did no damage to the stained glass,
which is St. Mary’s great glory and has
itself had an eventful existence; for some
of it was in old St. Chad’s when it fell,
and much of it, long ago, filled the windows
of religious houses in Germany.</p>

<p>The slender columns and pointed arches
of this lovely church have rung to the
voice of Charles I., who once proclaimed
his good intentions within these walls, and
knelt, harassed and nearly uncrowned, before
this altar. It was in St. Mary’s, too, that
James II. touched for the King’s Evil.</p>

<p>Just beyond the church is the Crown
Hotel, and whether we stay there or at the
“Raven,” a hundred yards away, we shall
hear the bells of St. Mary’s, once described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
as “the comfortablest ring of bells in all
the town,” and the chiming clock that was
the bequest of Fanny Burney’s Uncle James,
and the curfew, which still rings every
night at nine. And after the curfew we
shall hear the number of the day of the
month rung out&mdash;a relic of the times before
cheap almanacs existed.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the most satisfactory
way of seeing Shropshire is to spend
a few nights in Shrewsbury, and make it
the basis of operations; for Shrewsbury lies
exactly in the centre of the county, and is
the meeting-point of a particularly large
number of good roads. The old town itself,
too, does not deserve to be hurried through.
The longer one stays in it the more one
feels the charm of its gentle old age.</p>

<p>The Old School Buildings are within a
stone’s-throw of us, with all their memories
of the wise and great: memories that are,
as a matter of fact, older than themselves;
for though Charles Darwin was educated
within these very walls, it was in an older
building of wood, standing on the same spot,
that Philip Sidney was a schoolboy&mdash;gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and grave, and as much loved then as he was
destined to be all his life, and is still. It
was while he was here that his father wrote
him a “very godly letter ... most necessarie
for all yoong gentlemen to be carried in
memorie,” which his mother, who added a
postscript “in the skirts of my Lord President’s
letter,” considered to be so full of
“excellent counsailes,” that she begged Philip
to “fayle not continually once in foure or
five daies to reade them over.” The counsels
were certainly excellent. “Be humble and
obedient to your master,” says Sir Henry,
“... be courteous of gesture.... Give yourself
to be merie ... but let your mirth be
ever void of all scurrillitie and biting words
to any man.... Above all things, tell no
untruth, no not in trifles”; and he ends
quaintly: “Well, my little Philip, this is
enough for me, and I feare too much for
you.” If my Lord President had not also
been my Lord Deputy of Ireland one might
have loved him nearly as much as his son.</p>

<p>Neither he nor Philip ever saw the timbered
gatehouse that stands opposite to the Old
School Buildings, but in the red Council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
House to which it leads, Sir Henry always
stayed when he made official visits to Shrewsbury.
There were fine doings on these
occasions; banquets and processions, with
“knightly robes most valiant,” and many
scarlet gowns; masquerades, too, by the boys
of the school, who appeared now as soldiers,
now as nymphs, and made orations in both
characters. Later on the same red house
sheltered Charles I., when he came here to
collect men and money. Half the plate in
the county disappeared into his mint, which
was set up, some say, in a little tottering
house that may still be seen in an alley on
Pride Hill&mdash;a fragment of green and weather-worn
stone that is one of the most picturesque
things in Shrewsbury. Some of the money
that Charles “borrowed” on this occasion
was well spent in repairing the Castle, which
is quite near the Council House. The Castle
is now a private dwelling, and one cannot
walk about the grounds without permission;
but the oldest part of it is the great entrance-gate,
which all may see; the gate that was
built by Roger de Montgomery and attacked
by Stephen; the gate through which Henry IV.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
rode out to the famous Battle of Shrewsbury.
The Castle itself, as it now stands, was
probably mostly built by Edward I.; but it
suffered so much through the centuries from
siege, and treachery, and time, that many
repairs were necessary to secure it a peaceful
old age as a dwelling-house. Every motorist
who is properly grateful to his benefactors,
will be interested to know that it was the
engineer Telford who carried out these
repairs. He actually lived in the Castle for
a time, I believe, and he certainly built the
“Laura” tower, which stands on the foundations
of the old watch-tower. Telford was
in Shrewsbury when the tower of Old St.
Chad’s showed signs of collapsing, and, on
his advice being asked, said the church
should be repaired without delay. The
Parish Vestry begged him to meet them in
St. Chad’s to discuss the matter, and demurred
so long at the expense that at last Telford
walked out of the church, saying grimly that
he would rather talk the matter over in some
place where there was less danger of the
roof falling on his head. Two or three days
later it fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Not far from the fragments of this ruined
church is the High Street, where are some
of the oldest and prettiest houses in the
town; and hard by is the Tudor marketplace,
with its statue of Richard, Duke of
York. The claims of the Unitarian chapel
in the same street are not based on beauty,
but on the fact that Coleridge’s voice once
rose in it “like a steam of rich distilled
perfumes,” according to William Hazlitt, who
had walked ten miles to hear Coleridge
preach here, and was as much delighted, he
says, “as if he had heard the music of the
spheres.” Charles Darwin attended the
services of this chapel as a boy, but was
baptized in New St. Chad’s, the eighteenth-century
church near the Quarry, within
whose classical walls Dr. Johnson once worshipped.
The Doctor’s famous rolling walk,
too, of which we have all heard so much,
was once seen under the splendid limes of
the Quarry.</p>

<p>As we entered Shrewsbury by the English
Bridge we caught a glimpse of the Abbey
behind us. Leaving the town by the London
Road, on our way to see something of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
eastern side of the county, we shall pass
close by the old red building that was partly
spared when Roger de Montgomery’s great
monastery was dissolved. It will be worth
while to stop the engine for a moment, and
to look at the massive Norman piers of the
nave, the fine altar-tombs, and the fragment
of St. Winifred’s shrine. The founder himself
was buried here, after a long life of
storm and stress, and three days in a monk’s
habit; but the knightly figure that has been
thought to represent him is said by the best
authorities to be of a later date than his.
This Roger is very prominent in Shropshire
history, and is, indeed, not unknown in that
of England, for he figured in the Battle of
Hastings, and wherever he figured he made
himself felt. We hear many conflicting
things of his character, but from them all
we gather that he was a typical man of his
day, spending his time chiefly in acquiring
his neighbour’s goods, and his leisure moments
in building abbeys. Having built this Abbey
of Shrewsbury he was careful to see that
other people enriched it, and it soon became
one of the most important in England. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
actual buildings covered ten acres: yet now
all of it that we can see is this restored
church, and, across the road, a relic of a
later date. There, in the din and dust of a
coal-yard, stands the graceful stone pulpit
that was once in the refectory wall. From
under its delicately carved canopy a lay
brother read pious works aloud to the monks
while they ate.</p>

<p>As we drive up the Abbey Foregate, between
the trees and old houses, the memory
of the Benedictines is with us still; for it
was down this road that the monks, with
their abbot at their head, came once in
solemn procession with the bones of St. Winifred.
These, by the combined use of a smooth
tongue and a stout spade, they had brought
triumphantly away from the churchyard of
a Welsh village, knowing full well that no
wealth of lands and churches enriched a
monastery so surely as a handful of saintly
dust.</p>

<p>At the top of the Foregate is the column
on which Lord Hill stands above a list of
his battles. Here we keep to the London
Road, and are soon in the open country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
We are bound for Boscobel, but as there is
a good deal to be seen on the way, a round
of forty-three miles is not as short as it
seems. Between Shrewsbury and Atcham the
scenery is not particularly interesting, but
the road is level and the surface good, so
we have our compensations. From the
picturesque bridge at Atcham there is a
lovely view of distant Caradoc, with the
Severn in the foreground, and on the river
bank the old church that is said to have
been largely built, like that at Wroxeter, of
the stones from the Roman city of Uriconium.
We are very near that city now. If we take
the first turn to the right after leaving
Atcham, we shall soon be actually passing over
the ashes of “the White Town in the Woodland,”
as it was called by the Welsh poet who
sang of its tragic end; and a moment later
we shall see, near the roadside, a fragment of
the wall of its basilica. By asking for the
key at a cottage close at hand, and by paying
sixpence, we may see also the remains
of its public baths, and a piece of tesselated
pavement that might have been laid down
yesterday. Many relics of this town that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
was built by the Romans, inhabited by the
British, and burnt by the Saxons, have been
found within the limits of the hundred and
seventy acres that it once covered: skeletons
of men and women crouching where they
had vainly sought safety in the hypocausts
of the burning baths; coins scattered by
fugitives; pathetic trifles of women’s dress&mdash;hairpins,
buckles, and a brooch whose pin
still works. Older than these are the urns
and tombstones found in the Roman cemetery;
the tombstone of Petronius, who is
thought to have taken part in the victory
over Boadicea; and that of “Placida, aged
fifty-four, raised by the care of her husband.”
Most of the relics have been moved, for safe
keeping, to the Museum in Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>From Uriconium a very pretty road leads
us to Buildwas. The Severn winds below
us on the right, and on the hillside to the
left is the little village of Eaton Constantine,
which Constantine the Norman&mdash;who
also gave his name to the Côtentin in
France&mdash;held in the days of Domesday
Book at a rental of a pair of white
gloves, valued at one penny. Even at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
distance is visible the black-and-white gable
of the farmhouse that was once the home
of Richard Baxter, author of “The Saints’
Everlasting Rest,” and an amazing number
of other books&mdash;enough, said Judge Jeffreys,
“to load a cart.” Dr. Johnson, however,
pronounced them to be “all good.” Here,
we learn, Baxter “passed away his Childhood
and Youth, which upon Reflection he,
according to the Wise Man’s Censure, found
to be vanity.” In spite of these austere
views, however, his childhood was not
without its wild oats, for we are told
that he “joyn’d sometimes with other
Naughty Boys in Robbing his Neighbours’
Orchards of their Fruit, when he had eno’
at home ... and was bewitched with a
love of Romances and Idle Tales.”</p>

<p>Presently, after passing through the pretty
village of Leighton-under-the-Wrekin, we
see Buildwas, the Shelter near the Water,
on the further side of the river. Perhaps
this is the most striking view of the
fourteen massive pillars of this roofless
nave, in which the Cistercians of the
twelfth century austerely worshipped; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
we can visit the ruins if we wish to do
so by crossing the bridge that has quite
recently superseded one built by Telford.
There is not very much more to be seen
at close quarters than from here: the
great charm of Buildwas lies in its effect
as a whole, in its simplicity and strength,
and in its position by the river.</p>

<p>About a mile beyond Buildwas is Ironbridge,
named from the first bridge ever
built in England of iron, which here spans
the Severn at a height of forty feet, by
a single arch of a hundred feet in width.
It was the work of Abraham Darby, the
third of his name, and was finished in
1779. A gradient of 1 in 10 takes us
through Ironbridge, and less than two
miles further on is Madeley, which appears
at first sight the very type of all that is
unromantic, a prey to coal-dust and miners;
yet if we turn off the main road to the
left we shall presently find, hidden in a
hollow near Madeley Court Station, as
poetic a spot as we shall see in many
a day’s journey. Perhaps its very contrast
to its surroundings adds to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
charm; perhaps to some it may not seem
charming at all, but merely a tumble-down,
ill-kept house. But to others this little
nook, with the weather-stained, crumbling
walls and tiled gables of the Court House,
the swinging ivy, the still pond, the bulrushes
and water-lilies, and the red-and-black
timbered barn that once sheltered a
fugitive king, are a “faery land forlorn,”
the very home of glamour and romance.
Here Charles II. arrived one night, dressed
in green breeches and a noggen shirt. He
was tired and hungry, his hands and face
were smudged with soot, and he answered
to the name of William Jones. He was
refreshed in this house, and spent the
next day in the barn with Richard
Penderel, one of the five brothers to whom
he owed his safety. When night fell he
walked to Boscobel.</p>

<p>It was hours before he was there,
whereas we, if we were as much hurried
as he was, might be there in half an hour
or so. But though there is nothing to
keep us at Shifnal we must pause at Tong,
where there are some especially pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
timbered cottages and a church that is
really remarkable, for it contains a collection
of tombs which I should imagine to
be unequalled in a village church. They
are those of the Vernon family, and
among them is that of Dame Margaret
Stanley, the sister of Dorothy Vernon, of
Haddon Hall. Charles Dickens said himself
that it was of Tong Village he was
thinking when he wrote the end of “The
Old Curiosity Shop,” and those to whom
Little Nell appeals may think of her and
her grandfather in the porch of this
church. Some of us, however, will take
more interest in the shot-marks that have
scarred the northern wall ever since the
days of the Civil War.</p>

<p>In a park near the village stands the
astonishing structure called Tong Castle.
It was once a real castle of stone; in the
sixteenth century Sir Henry Vernon rebuilt
it of brick; in the eighteenth a new owner
thought that Moorish cupolas would make
a pretty finish to it. When, in 1643, it was
in the possession of the Parliamentarians, it
was said on that account to be a “great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
eye-sore to his Majesty’s good subjects who
pass’d yt road.” For other reasons it is
so still.</p>

<p>A writer of the seventeenth century
describes Boscobel as “a very obscure habitation,
situate in a kind of wilderness”;
and no doubt it was to this obscurity that
Charles II. owed his safety. Even to-day it
is wonderfully isolated, and we reach it by
a series of rather circuitous by-roads; but
we can drive right up to the house, and
leave our car in a safe enclosure, while we
walk a hundred yards to the Royal Oak&mdash;not
the original “asylum of the most potent
prince King Charles II. ... the oak beloved
by Jove,”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which was mostly made into snuff-boxes
and other treasures for the loyal&mdash;but
an oak grown from an acorn of that
“fortunate tree.” When Charles reached
Boscobel at three o’clock in the morning he
was taken into the big panelled room that
we shall presently see, and was refreshed
with bread and cheese and a posset of milk
and beer. Colonel Carlis, another fugitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
from Worcester, “pulled off his Majesty’s
shoos, which were full of gravel, and
stockens which were very wet,” and at daybreak
went with him into the wood, where
they both climbed into the oak&mdash;here,
where we are standing&mdash;with a cushion
for his Majesty to sit on. Here, for a
great part of the day, the tired King
slept with his head on Colonel Carlis’s
knee. “He bore all these hardships and
afflictions with incomparable patience,” says
a contemporary historian. At night he was
hidden in the house, buried beneath the
garret floor in a box-like priest’s-hole, with
a load of cheese on the lid. We may
climb the stairs and see it; get into it if
we will&mdash;and ask ourselves if, after spending
a night in it, we should be as lighthearted
as this man who at any moment
might lose his life and had already lost
everything else. In the morning he called
for a frying-pan and butter, and, having
first despatched Colonel Carlis with a
dagger to slaughter a neighbour’s sheep,
he gaily cooked himself some mutton
collops, while the Colonel, “being but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
under-cook (and that honour enough too),
made the fire and turned the collops in
the pan.”</p>

<p>From Boscobel we strike due north to
Ivetsey Bank, where we shall find an inn
capable of providing a good, if homely,
luncheon or tea. Thence sixteen miles on
Watling Street will bring us without a
pause (<i>unberufen!</i>) through Wellington to
the point where we left the main road on
our outward journey. It is worth while,
by the way, to avoid the unpleasant bit
of road through Oakengates by striking
across to the main road from Shifnal; to
do which we must take a turn in St.
George’s, where a lamp-post stands out
prominently. We enter Shrewsbury, as we
left it, by the London Road.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A slightly longer run, covering about fifty
miles altogether, will show us something of
the northern part of the county on its
western side. We drive out of the town
past the station and through the squalid
suburb of Ditherington, where, for love of
our springs and of humanity, we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
perforce drive slowly, by reason of the
bumpiness of the surface and the phenomenal
number of children. Over this ground rode
Henry IV. and Prince Hal to the Battle
of Shrewsbury, and there on our right is
Haughmond Hill, the “busky hill” to which
Shakespeare refers. Presently there appears
on the left, a few hundred yards away
from the road, the church of Battlefield,
raised, with the exception of the tower,
quite soon after the battle on the spot
where the fight raged most fiercely, in
order that masses might be sung perpetually
“for the prosperity of the King and
the souls of the slain.” Here Harry Hotspur
died, and with him thousands of others
both gentle and simple, for this was a very
notable fight and many interests were concerned
in it. Beneath the mounds that we
see on the south side of the church are the
bones of many of the slain. The King “had
many marching in his coats,” as Hotspur
puts it in “Henry IV.,” and as they were
killed in mistake for him he saved himself
by a device more ingenious than kingly.</p>

<p>There is nothing of special note between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Battlefield and Hawkestone, which is about
twelve miles from Shrewsbury, and is a
private park, open to visitors. In the rhododendron
season it is well worth while to
leave one’s car at the extremely nice hotel
at the outskirts of the park, and to walk
about a mile through pretty grounds swarming
with black rabbits, to see the blaze of
blossom for which Hawkestone is famous.
And yet I think they will fare still better
who choose the time of bluebells. These
should drive through the park by the public
road. Beyond the gate, where the stream is
close to them on the right and woods slope
to its edge, they will see, bright in the near
foreground but fading away into the distance
under the trees in a misty cloud, a soft,
ethereal veil of grey-blue. Here and there
the green breaks through, and the flowers
look like wisps of smoke trailing across the
grass. This wonderful sheet of mystic blue
borders the river and the road for some
way, till the wood ends suddenly, and Hodnet
Hall comes in sight.</p>

<p>One really grows a little tired of recording
the picturesqueness of Shropshire villages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
They are nearly all pretty: for the houses,
when they are not of timber and plaster,
are often built of the warm red sandstone
that is the stone of the county and acquires
such soft, mellow colours in its old age. But
I sometimes think Hodnet is the prettiest
village of them all. Half the houses are
black-and-white; and near the church gate a
group of timber gables, with the octagonal
tower in the background, forms a complete and
perfectly composed picture. Bishop Reginald
Heber, the author of “From Greenland’s icy
mountains,” was rector of Hodnet for some
years before he sailed for “India’s coral strand.”</p>

<p>From Hodnet we may either drive back to
Shrewsbury or turn to the left in the middle
of the village and take a run of about thirty-four
miles by Market Drayton and Newport,
two picturesque old towns with a good road
between them. The scenery in this part of the
county is pleasing, but not especially striking.
If we choose this way we shall, as we draw
near Shrewsbury, pass the ruins of Haughmond,
one of the great Shropshire abbeys.</p>

<p>Long ago there was a hermitage at the
foot of this “busky hill”; before William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
FitzAlan’s monastery for Austin Canons rose
here, with the great church that has practically
disappeared,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and the tall gable with
the turrets that are so conspicuous to-day,
and the chapter-house with the beautiful
doorway. This Abbey was greatly patronised
by royalty. Stephen gave it a mill, Matilda
gave it lands “for the remission of her
sins,” Henry II. gave churches, and Henry III.
more land, and Llewelyn of Wales “a moiety
of Kenwicke.” The list of other benefactions
is endless: mills and fisheries, churches and
markets, woods and hogs and herds. Many
were the “privileges of flesh and fish”
enjoyed by the canons of Haughmond; and
Abbot Nicholas, in Edward III.’s time, desiring
to make the most of all these luxuries,
built a new kitchen for the brethren and
“appointed them a cook to dress their food.”
It was in 1541 that Henry VIII., as his
manner was, took possession of Haughmond
and all its riches, “beyng mynded to take
the same into his own handes for a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
purpose”; and so the minster, for which he
had no use, gradually vanished. Nothing is
left of it but a fragment of wall and a
doorway. Two tombs that were once within
the chancel now lie open to the sky on the
hillside, where their appeal for the prayers
of the passers-by is of far more pathetic
force than it ever was under the shelter of
the Abbey’s roof:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<i>Vous Ki Passez Par Ici Priez Pur L’Alme Johan
Fitz Aleine Ki Git Ici. Deu De Sa Alme

<p class="caption">HAUGHMOND ABBEY.</p></div>

<p>From this road near Haughmond we have
perhaps the loveliest view of distant Shrewsbury.
The pale hills rim the horizon, the
river winds in the foreground, and between
them rise the clear outlines of the two incomparable
spires that crown The Delight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another of the Shropshire monasteries that
must certainly be seen is Wenlock Priory,
which lies on the way to Bridgnorth. It is
a fairly level road that leads to it by Cross
Houses and Cound and pretty Cressage, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
in Domesday Book is Cristes-ache, or Christ’s
Oak. Christianity was preached here, it is
said, under an old oak-tree, in days so early
that when St. Augustine visited the place he
found it already Christian. Between Harley
and Wenlock there is a hill which the Contour
Book describes with perfect accuracy as
“a precipitous hill on which innumerable
accidents have happened.” The accidents, I
fancy, have mostly happened to horse-drawn
vehicles and bicycles&mdash;especially the latter&mdash;when
descending the hill, for it is a mile
long and has a turn in the middle. There
is no reason why it should inconvenience a
good car, for the average gradient is nothing
more alarming than 1 in 8, and it is well
worth climbing for the sake of the wide
view from the top, just beyond which Much
Wenlock lies.</p>

<p class="caption">WENLOCK PRIORY, ST. JOHN’S CHAPEL.</p></div>

<p>Milburga, Saxon princess and saint, built
the first religious house at Wenlock, and
became its abbess, and was finally buried
within its precincts. William of Malmesbury
tells us how, long after her death, she enriched
the place to which she had given her
life and all she possessed. “Milburga,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
says, “reposes at Wenlock ... but for some
time after the arrival of the Normans,
through ignorance of the place of her burial,
she was neglected. Lately, however, a convent
of Clugniac monks being established
there, while a new church was erecting, a
certain boy, running violently along the
pavement, broke into the hollow of the
vault, and discovered the body of the virgin,
when a balsamic odour pervading the whole
church, she was taken up, and performed so
many miracles that the people flocked thither
in great multitudes. Large spreading plains
could hardly contain the troops of pilgrims,
while rich and poor came side by side, one
common faith compelling all.”</p>

<p>The convent of Clugniac monks in question
was built by that notable man Roger de
Montgomery, and was the same whose ruins
speak so plainly to-day of the ornate tastes
of the monks of Clugny. We saw no arcaded
walls such as these of the chapter-house,
nor richly moulded doorways, nor any such
elaborate ornament at Cistercian Buildwas,
whose lands marched with the lands of this
Priory, and whose monks found the Rule of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Clugny too soft, the tastes of Clugny too
enervating. Go to Wenlock in the spring,
when its slender columns rise above a sea
of sweet-scented flowers, and its old wall is
bright with rock-plants&mdash;for the Priory stands
in private grounds and is cared for like
a garden. It is the third religious house
that has stood on this spot, for between the
days of Milburga, the royal saint, and those
of Roger and his Clugniacs, there was
another monastery founded here by Leofric
of Mercia and his wife Godiva, a well-loved
woman whom we are glad to connect with
this beautiful spot. The picturesque old
Prior’s Lodge is inhabited, and it is only on
Tuesdays and Fridays that the world at large
is admitted to the ruins. Perhaps nothing
recalls to one so vividly the daily life of
the monks in this place as the long causeway
that stretches across the field near the Priory
garden. It was here that the brothers took
their daily exercise, raised above the surrounding
marsh&mdash;a long procession of dark
figures, walking slowly to and fro&mdash;and
among them, unsuspected, that interesting
swashbuckler of whom we long to hear more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
that man of extremes whose strange career
is all summed up for us in one short, pregnant
sentence. “In 1283,” we learn, “a
brother of Wenlac became a captain of
banditti.” We hear no more of him, alas!
except that he was hanged.</p>

<p>The road to Bridgnorth is a continuation
of the one by which we entered the town,
so we must drive back, past the beautiful
old Guildhall and market-place, up the street
to the Gaskell Arms, where we may have
luncheon if, as may well occur to motorists,
we are too hungry to wait till we reach
the more imposing “Crown” at Bridgnorth.
At the Gaskell Arms we turn sharply to
the left, and thence eight or nine miles of
good road, with several steep hills, will bring
us to Bridgnorth.</p>

<p>Ever since the Danes built a fort here this
town, nearly as consistently as Shrewsbury
and Ludlow, has concerned itself with
history. It has been visited by half the
kings of England. Henry I. besieged it;
Henry II. defended it; John and Edward I.
stayed in it; Edward II. took refuge in it;
Henry IV. gathered his army here on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
way to the Battle of Shrewsbury; Charles I.
was besieged here by Cromwell, who narrowly
escaped death before the walls. The
Castle, of course, was the centre of interest
on all these occasions&mdash;the Castle that was
built so hurriedly by Robert de Belesme,
Roger de Montgomery’s son, and is now so
conspicuous on account of its leaning tower.
Round its ruins is a path that must be
practically the same as that which Charles I.
declared to be as pleasant a walk as any in
his kingdom. Robert de Belesme, who has
been described with apparent justice as “an
implacable villain,” also founded the church
of St. Mary Magdalene, but the present
building was designed by Telford. Another
interesting church is St. Leonard’s, where in
the churchyard the Roundheads once beat
the Royalists in a skirmish, and where
Richard Baxter was a curate. He lived in
the little black-and-white cottage close at
hand, and seems to have had a poor
opinion of his flock. “He found the people
here generally ignorant and dead-hearted,”
he says, “... so that though by his first
Labours among them he was Instrumental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
in the Conversion of several Persons, and
was generally Applauded, yet ... Tippling
and Ill Company rendred his Preaching
ineffectual.” If his preaching was ineffectual
it at all events began early, for “when
he was a little Boy in Coats, if he heard
other Children in Play speak Profane Words
he would reprove them, to the wonder of
those that heard him.” At this time&mdash;when
he was a little Boy in Coats&mdash;he lived
at Rowton in this county; it was not till
he was ten years old that he moved to
Eaton Constantine and indulged in dark
deeds in his neighbours’ orchards.</p>

<p>An extremely steep dip with an awkward
corner in the middle of it will take us
to the birthplace of another famous divine,
Bishop Percy, best known in connection
with “Percy’s Reliques.” The house, which
stands in the Cartway, may be approached
quite comfortably from below, and is worth
seeing for its own sake, being a good
example of black-and-white work.</p>

<p>Our best way home from here is by
Ironbridge and Buildwas, on the road by
which we drove to Boscobel. Between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Bridgnorth and Ironbridge some of the
country is pretty, and at Broseley especially
it must have been lovely in its natural
state, before it was ruined by the potteries.
We cross the river by Abraham Darby’s
iron bridge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A run of forty-seven miles or so, by
Wem, Whitchurch, and Ellesmere, will show
us a good deal of the north-west part of
the county, and if, when we reach Whitchurch,
we choose to lengthen the distance
to fifty-four miles by slipping over the
Welsh border to Overton and Erbistock, we
shall not regret it.</p>

<p>We leave Shrewsbury by the road that
branches to the left immediately opposite
to the station. Almost at once, at the
point where the road touches the Severn,
we pass a long, low house of timber and
plaster on our right. It was from this
house that Admiral Benbow ran away to
sea. He was living here as an apprentice,
to his father or another, and, since it was
the custom to entrust the house-key to the
care of the apprentice, he had, fortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
for himself and England, special facilities
for making his escape. He hid the key in
the tree that is marked with a ring of
whitewash, and stands between the house
and the railings; and there to this day it
hangs.</p>

<p>Between Shrewsbury and Whitchurch
there is nothing of particular interest
except the old farmhouse called Albright
Hussey, which stands in a field on the
right about three miles out of Shrewsbury.
It is a pretty old moated house, partly
black-and-white; but its greatest beauty is
within, where there is as charming a room
as one need wish to see, a room to make a
housewife weep tears of covetousness&mdash;low,
oblong, oak-panelled to the ceiling, with
seats in the mullioned windows and a carved
fireplace. The house is inhabited, but I
believe there is never any difficulty in
obtaining leave to see it. Its sixteenth-century
walls were once threatened by a
party of Parliamentarian horse. There were
only eight men to defend the place, but
their leader was a crafty man, and shouted
his orders aloud within hearing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
enemy. “Let ten men stay here, and ten
go there, and twenty stay with me!” he
cried; and the attacking force, dismayed
by the number of mythical defenders, rode
away and left the stone and timber, the
mullioned windows and oaken wainscotes,
to be a joy to us to-day.</p>

<p>In Wem, however, through which we
presently pass, it was the “Parliament
men” who were in the ascendent. The
place acted a prominent part in the Civil
War, and has a history many centuries long,
but on the surface is commonplace enough.
In the List of the Owners of the Manor of
Wem the twenty-fourth name is the grim
one of “Sir George Jeffreys, Knight and
Baronet, and Lord Chief Justice of the
King’s Bench, created in 1685 a peer of
England by the style and title of Baron
Jeffreys of Wem.”</p>

<p>At Whitchurch we must draw up at the
door of St. Alkmund’s Church; not because
it is old or beautiful, for the original church
fell down in 1711 and was entirely rebuilt;
nor because Dean Swift subscribed to the
rebuilding of it; but because it contains the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
dust of the great Talbot, first Earl of
Shrewsbury, “the scourge of France.” His
valiant heart lies beneath the white stone
in the porch, where careless thousands
have trodden it underfoot. It was found
there in an urn when the church was
rebuilt, and with it were some figures of
Christ and the Virgin Mary from Talbot’s
rosary. His bones are in the chancel,
whither, about fifty years after his death,
they were brought from the battlefield of
Chastillon, where a little chapel had been
raised on the spot where he fell.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> His
effigy lies on a tomb that is an exact
copy of the original one. While this
restoration was in progress the bones of
the great soldier were shown to the
public, with the skull cleft by the axe that
killed him. “This is that terrible Talbot,”
says Thomas Fuller, “so famous for his
sword ... which constantly conquered
where it came, insomuch that the bare
fame of his approach frighted the French
from the siege of Bordeaux. Being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
victorious for twenty-four years together,
success failed him at last.... Henceforward
we may say ‘Good-night to the
English in France,’ whose victories were
buried with the body of this earl.”</p>

<p>From Whitchurch we drive about fourteen
miles in a westerly direction to Overton
Bridge, by Hanmer and Overton village, a
pretty little place with a churchyard surrounded
by yew-trees. Having crossed the
bridge, which is about two miles beyond
the village, we turn to the left at right
angles and approach Erbistock by a road
whose greatest recommendation to inveterate
lovers of speed will be that it is short. After
one experience, however, most of us will
agree, I think, that this by-road needs no
recommendation but the fact that it leads
to Erbistock. A tiny church and a tiny inn
at the brim of the Dee&mdash;that is all that
there is at Erbistock. But it is all enclosed
in trees, and the trees dip into the river,
and the river is rather big and gentle and
gurgles sweetly at one’s feet, and the woods
on the other side are tangled and mysterious
and full of fairies. One may have one’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
tea close beside the water, or one may cross
the river in a ferry, and soon be quite alone
in the woods. There is no need to hurry,
for when we leave Erbistock we need not
stop again till we reach Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>For Ellesmere, “wher was a castelle,”
says Leland, “and very fair polis yet be,”
has now nothing left of its castle but the
memory of it, and the fair pools may be
seen as we pass. More than once Ellesmere
was given as a dowry to the daughters of
English kings, on their marriage with Cymric
princes; for as the rulers of the two countries
were sure to fall out soon after the wedding
the gift was quickly taken back by the donor,
and so was ready for the next bride. Thus,
though Henry II. gave it to his sister Emma,
there was nothing to prevent King John
from giving it to his daughter Joan, twenty-seven
years later, when she married Llewelyn
the Great.</p>

<p>I think it must have been beside the lake,
where on the level ground there would be
room for the dramatic scene, that Rupert,
halting here at Ellesmere, made his prisoners
cast lots upon the drum to decide which of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
them should die. Thirteen were doomed;
but at the last moment one of them was
saved by Sir Vincent Corbet, who as he rode
past interceded for the man, who had been
a servant in his family. The rest were
hanged there and then. Yet it is not they
who haunt the rushy banks of the mere;
but the White Lady of Oteley. Long ago,
it is said, she robbed and ruined a monastery,
and built herself a home here with the
spoils&mdash;a home that she has never left since
then, except to walk by night along the
margin of the water. She was not even
allowed to move to the new house when
it was built about a hundred years ago,
for a fragment of the old one was left
standing in the park on purpose for her
accommodation. The new house faces us
very conspicuously as we drive close beside
the water on the opposite side of the mere,
and go on our way to Shrewsbury, which is
about sixteen miles away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the south-west, which is the hilliest,
and therefore the prettiest, part of Shropshire,
there is a variety of little runs, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
may be lengthened or shortened according
to circumstances and tastes. A pretty round
of about fifty miles is by Chirbury and
Bishop’s Castle, whence either of two lovely
roads will bring us back to Shrewsbury.
Nineteen miles of nearly level road lead to
Chirbury through several villages&mdash;Westbury,
Worthen, Marton, and others&mdash;all of which
are fairly picturesque, but with nothing very
noteworthy about them. Just before Marton
is reached there is an exceedingly sharp
turn, which should be borne in mind. At
Chirbury our road turns to the left in the
middle of the village.</p>

<p>The name of this obscure little place has
been known to the world for some centuries
in connection with that strange person Lord
Herbert of Chirbury, half ruffler, half
scholar, who in a house only a few miles
from here, across the Welsh border, wrote
the famous autobiography that Horace
Walpole called “perhaps the most extraordinary
account that was ever given seriously
by a wise man of himself.” His home
for the greater part of his life, when he
was not seeking adventures and duels in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
France or London, was in Montgomery
Castle, whose ruins we may see by driving
four miles further. Nothing but a fragment
is left of it now, but when the Herberts
lived there it must have been a fine sight
on its wild crag; a more fitting home for
Edward the soldier than for his gentler and
still more famous brother George. Chirbury
itself had a castle and a priory once; but
of the castle, which was built by the ever
active Ethelfleda, nothing remains but the
site; and of the monastery there are only
fragments left, for the present church,
ancient as it is, was not used by the monks,
but was then, as now, the parish church.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
It has seen strange doings. It is hard to
realise, when the bells ring in this lonely
little village, and the quiet country folk
take their seats for the morning service,
that here within these very walls the congregation
of Chirbury was once electrified
by the clashing of armour and the clatter
of horses’ hoofs in the aisle. It was during
the Civil War, and Mr. Edward Lewis, “a
very goodly man, did preach twice a day”;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
a rash thing for a Puritan to do when
Captain Corbet was no further off than
Caus Castle. A party of Royalist horse “rode
into the church to the great fright and
amazement of the people; and with their
pistols charged and cocked went up into
the pulpit and pulled down Mr. Lewis,
pulling and tugging him in a most unworthy
manner ... and so left the people
without their pastor because they would
not be content with one sermon a day.”</p>

<p>It was this same Edward Lewis who
brought to Chirbury the chained library
that almost certainly belonged to George
Herbert; for Isaac Walton tells us of “a
choice library which Mr. Herbert had
fastened with chains in a fit room in
Montgomery Castle.” This choice library
contains books dating from 1530 to 1684,
and among them is a black-letter folio copy
of Chaucer. They are kept in the vicarage,
and I believe may be seen by any one.</p>

<p>Turning to the left in Chirbury we soon
pass Marrington Hall, or <i>Havodwen</i>, the
White Summer-house, as the Welsh call it;
a very fine example of sixteenth-century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
black-and-white work. The lovely little
valley beyond it is Marrington Dingle, and
a mile or two further on is Churchstoke. It
is in this pretty part of Shropshire that
the uses of the motor-car are especially
noticeable, for railway stations are few and
distant from each other, and the hilliness of
the country is not encouraging to bicyclists.
Of Bishop’s Castle there is little to be said,
for pretty as the country is all round it, the
town itself is unattractive, and the castle
is no more. But all the ways back to
Shrewsbury from here are lovely. We may
join the Stretton road, which we already
know, at Marshbrook, and so see one of the
most charming little bits of wooded country
in Shropshire; or we may follow the hilly
road through the wild scenery near Ratlinghope,
down Cothercott Hill, and through
Longden and Hookagate. Cothercott Hill
is very steep and has a bad surface, but
it is only for a short way that the gradient
is really severe, and the view from
the top is one of the wildest in the country.
Personally, however, I should recommend
the third way back to Shrewsbury&mdash;over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the moor to the Roman Gravels, and down
through the woods of the winding Hope
Valley to Minsterley.</p>

<p>As there is nothing in the whole of this
little run to delay us, we may lengthen it,
if our car is good on hills and we are of
an enterprising temperament, by going on
from Bishop’s Castle to Clun, or even to
Knighton, and round by Leintwardine to
join the Ludlow road. This is a beautiful
bit of country, and full of interest. Leland
tells us of the “faire forest of Clun.”
“Cumming from Bisshop’s Castelle to Clunne
lordshippe,” he says, “cummeth doune a
greate woode grouing on a hille.” Much of
this great wood is gone now, but there is
still enough to make the country very
“faire,” and to compensate a motorist for
the climbing of a long hill. Suddenly, as
we round a corner, Clun comes into sight
between two hills, with the stern tower of
its castle standing conspicuously above the
river. “Clunne Castell,” says Leland, “longynge
to the Erle of Arundel, sumewhat
ruinus. It hath bene bothe stronge and
well builded.” It is more than somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
ruinous now, which is hardly surprising
when one considers all it has gone through
at the hands of Welshmen and Roundheads
since it was built in Stephen’s reign.
There is a story that the stones of which
it is made were passed from hand to hand
by a chain of men, from the quarry, a mile
away, to the river-bank where the castle
stands; but be that as it may, these crumbling
stones, with their soft tints of grey
and yellow, embody enough romance to
satisfy us, I think, seeing that they are
connected with all the greatest names of
Wales. They have been stormed and burnt
by Rhys of the south; they have been
attacked in vain by great Llewelyn of the
north; they have been overcome by Owen
Glyndwr. They are connected with modern
romance, too, for it is supposed that the
“Garde Dolareuse,” in the “Betrothed,”
represents the Castle of Clun, and the
Buffalo Inn claims to have sheltered Sir
Walter Scott while he was writing part of
the book.</p>

<p>Everything is old at Clun: the church; the
fine old bridge, of whose building there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
no record; and the “Hospital of the Holy
and Undivided Trinity at Clunn,” which was
founded by the Duke of Norfolk in 1614 for
distressed tradesmen, who were each to
receive yearly “a gown ready-made of
strong cloth or kersey, of a sad colour.”</p>

<p>The road between Clun and Knighton is
not one to be undertaken lightly by small
cars of uncertain hill-climbing powers, for it
is mostly composed of long and precipitous
hills, with gradients varying from 1 in 8
to 1 in 10; but the surface is good, and
though the scenery is not particularly interesting
at first, it becomes really lovely as
we draw near Knighton, which lies in a
valley, surrounded by wooded hills. Here
we turn to the left, and by way of compensation
the road from Knighton to Leintwardine
is particularly level, along a narrow
valley between green hills that belong to
Shropshire on the left and to Herefordshire
on the right. As the valley widens out
into open country we reach Brampton Brian,
associated for ever with the name of Brilliana,
Lady Harley. That gallant-hearted
lady was alone in her husband’s castle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Brampton when it was threatened by the
forces of Charles I., for the Harleys were
“Parliament men.” “I acknowleg,” she
writes, “I doe not thinke meself safe
wheare I am.” Safe she certainly was not,
but she thanked God that she was “not
afraide”; and when the Royalists bade her
surrender she simply answered, “I must
endeavour to keep what is mine as well as
I can, in which I have the law of nature, of
reason, and of the law on my side, and you
none to take it from me.” The siege lasted
some weeks, and Lady Harley, always delicate,
suffered greatly; but when pressed to
yield said “she would rather choose an
honourable death.” She died; but this first
siege was raised before her “heavenly and
happy end,” and so she never knew that the
castle was besieged again, was surrendered,
and burnt to the ground.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>A few miles further on is Leintwardine,
which I believe to be full of antiquarian
interest, and know to be picturesque as an
artist’s dream; and here, if we care to face
a narrow byway with a rough surface, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
may leave the main road and take the
more direct route to Craven Arms by way
of Clungunford. At Craven Arms we rejoin
the road from Ludlow to Shrewsbury.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of the many main roads that converge
in Shrewsbury I have left to the last the
one that is in some ways the most important,
the one that is certainly the most
famous; that road of great memories and
great achievement, by which so many Royal
Mails have travelled breathlessly at the
dashing pace of eleven miles an hour, and
by which we may travel to-day at a pace
that nothing shall induce me to betray:
Telford’s road to Holyhead. It is the road
by which, if we are fortunate, we are going
into North Wales. If, however, it is our sad
fate to turn our backs on that most beautiful
land, we must on no account neglect
to run over to Llangollen, a distance of
thirty miles: for though I have left it to
the last on the assumption that we are
going on to Wales, it is one of the most
enjoyable drives in this neighbourhood.</p>

<p>We leave Shrewsbury by the Welsh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Bridge, the scene of Henry VII.’s remarkable
entry into the town over the body of
the stout, wise bailiff; and as we reach the
top of the hill beyond it we pass on the
right the house in which Charles Darwin
was born. At the corner where the Holyhead
road turns sharply to the right, about
half a mile beyond the last houses of the
town, there stands in a private garden a
famous tree known as the Shelton Oak. I
mention it merely because its fame rests on
a libel. There are those who will tell you&mdash;cheerfully
taking a great man’s name in
vain&mdash;that Owen Glyndwr sat in this tree
watching the Battle of Shrewsbury when he
should have been taking part in it. Our
knowledge of this fiery prince’s characteristics
might be enough, one would think,
to discredit the tale, without the proved
fact that he was extremely occupied in
South Wales at the time! But still the tale
is told.</p>

<p>Soon, at Montford Bridge, we cross the
Severn, white with water-weeds in the summer,
and fringed with purple wild-flowers,
and then, with what speed we may, spin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
happily towards the Welsh hills. We can
see them on our left; the striking outline
of the Breidden, with Rodney’s Pillar on
its topmost point, and beyond it a long
blue range that limits all the western horizon.
At one spot only we have a choice of
roads. Telford’s road goes by Oswestry, an
ancient town with an immense history but
few relics; but if at the “Queen’s Head,”
fourteen miles from Shrewsbury, we turn to
the right, following the telegraph-posts, we
shall cut off more than a mile of distance
and shall see Whittington.</p>

<p>There are some places that are peculiarly
haunted. One is infinitely more conscious
in them of the past than of the present.
Such are Hay and Beaupré&mdash;both of which
we shall see later on. But Whittington is
not so much haunted as haunting. Hay and
Beaupré are enchanted: Whittington is itself
the enchantment. It stands in a clump of
trees by the wayside, in the middle of the
village, and one comes upon it suddenly: a
great fortified gateway of pale grey stone,
reflected in the weed-grown water of what
was once its moat&mdash;and leading nowhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
One thinks, not of its history, but of itself.
One cannot believe that it is merely the
entrance to a vanished mediæval castle; it
is rather the Gate of Dreams, through which
every man sometimes passes in search of his
heart’s desire.</p>

<p>There is an old Norman-French romance
that tells us how the White Tower was built
by William Peverel of the Peak, and how he
promised it as a dowry to Melette, the fairest
of his nieces. “But none found favour with
her. And William reasoned with her, and
besought her that she would discover unto
him if there was in the world any knight
whom she would take for lord.... ‘Certes,
Sire,’ said she, ‘no knight is there in all the
world that I would take for the sake of riches
and the honour of lands, but if I ever take
such an one he shall be handsome, and
courteous, and the most valiant of his order
in Christendom.’” So William proclaimed a
tourney at the Peak, with Melette and the
White Tower for the prize; and among those
who came to try their fortune was one
Guarin de Metz, well clad in red samite, with
a crest of gold. “To record the blows and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the issues I am not minded,” says the story,
“but Guarin de Metz and his company proved
that day the best, the fairest, and the most
valiant, and above all, Guarin was the most
praised in all ways.” So Guarin won the
fastidious Melette of the White Tower, “and
with great joy did he take her, and the
damsel him.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>This romance is not very reliable history,
I fear, but it is true that Whittington belonged
at one time to the Peverels, and later
to the Fitz-Warines or Guarins, of whom it
was probably the third who built this gate in
the reign of John.</p>

<p>Two miles beyond Whittington is Gobowen,
where we rejoin the main road; and soon
afterwards we dip into the narrow valley
below Chirk, and with the railway and the
canal high above us on the left, cross the
little Ceiriog into Wales.</p>

<h2><a name="A_TOUR_IN_NORTH_WALES" id="A_TOUR_IN_NORTH_WALES">A TOUR IN NORTH WALES</a></h2>

<p>Here, on the very border of Wales, one
is conscious of the Celtic atmosphere.
We left the quiet orderliness of England
behind us when we dipped down into this
little valley, where the sparkling, bubbling
Ceiriog&mdash;every inch a Celt&mdash;calls to us to
follow it up into the hills. And so we will,
as soon as we have climbed the other side
of the valley into Chirk village; turning
there to the left, though our rightful road,
the road to Llangollen, lies directly in front
of us. In Wales we shall find ourselves
constantly tempted to leave the highway,
and in most cases we shall be rewarded if
we yield to the temptation without ado. In
this particular case we shall be rewarded
with a dear little glen, feathery birch-trees
on the steep slopes, a yellow carpet in prim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>rose
time, and a most charming little hotel
about six miles up the valley, at Glyn
Ceiriog.</p>

<p>Near Chirk the road sweeps round under
the trees of the deer-park, where “there is
on a smaul hille a mighty large and stronge
castel with dyvers towers”; towers that have
stood here for many generations, defying
time and war; for this castle of Chirk is no
ruin like most of its contemporaries, but an
inhabited house. Yet not these towers, I
believe, but the old Welsh Castell Crogen,
stood here when Henry II., with “the chosen
warriors of England,” and of several other
countries, marched up this valley to join
battle with the great Owen Gwynedd and all
the might of Wales, who were encamped near
Corwen. The English, finding the trees in
their way, cut them down as they advanced,
which so much infuriated some of the Welsh
who were separated from their main army,
that the Ceiriog ran red with the blood of
Henry’s chosen warriors. This Battle of
Crogen took place just below the older
castle.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most dramatic event in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
life of the present Chirk Castle was when
it fell into the hands of the cavaliers, and
its owner, Sir Thomas Myddleton, a Parliamentary
leader, was obliged to besiege his
own house in his own person. I believe that
on one day of the week the world at large
is allowed to pass through the beautiful gates
of wrought iron, and up the long slope of
the avenue, and into the castle itself, to see
all the treasures of art and history that
George Borrow saw when he was here: the
cabinet of Charles II., and the portraits of
Nell Gwynne, and of “the very proud
daughter of the house,” as Borrow calls
Addison’s wife, “the Warwick Dowager who
married the Spectator, and led him the life
of a dog.”</p>

<p>Across Chirk Park runs Offa’s Dyke, the
long embankment “that was cast up with
great labour and industry by Offa the
Mercian, as a boundary between his Subjects
and the Britains, from the mouth of Dee to
that of the River Wye.... Concerning which
Joannes Sarisburiensis in his ‘Polycration’
saith that Harald establish’d a law that whatever
Welshman should be found arm’d on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
this side the limit he had set up, then ...
his right hand should be cut off by the
King’s Officers.” It touches the high-road
a few miles beyond Chirk, just before
we begin the wonderful descent into the
Vale of Llangollen; that long slope down
which we swing for several miles on a
perfect gradient and a perfect surface&mdash;marred,
however, by an awkward turn&mdash;with
the whole beautiful valley spread
out before us, and the Dee sweeping far
below us, spanned by the remarkable aqueduct
called Pont-y-Cysylltau. Beyond it rise
the Eglwyseg crags, and far away the
shattered fortress of Dinas Bran is visible
almost from the first on its peak above
Llangollen. “The castelle of Dinas Brane,”
says Leland, “was never a bigge thing, but
sette al for strenght as in a place half inaccessible
for enemyes.” Even in his day it
was “al in ruine,” and now there is only
a fragment left of it to remind us of those
princes of ancient Powys who built it in days
so old as to be unchronicled, and defied the
power of the Saxon from within its walls;
and of its owner in later days, Madoc ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Gryffyth Maelor, who built the Abbey of
Valle Crucis; and of the fair Myfanwy, “all
smiles and light,” who was loved by a poor
bard of the fourteenth century, and celebrated
by him in a poem that still exists.</p>

<p>At the foot of the crag on which Dinas
Bran is perched lies Llangollen&mdash;a little town
that owes its charm entirely to its position.
Only a few miles away, in Shropshire, an
ugly house is an exception: in Wales it is
unfortunately the rule. A town or village
that is really pretty in itself, apart from its
surroundings, is almost unknown. But so
lovely is the position of Llangollen that in
spite of its rather squalid streets it is an
entrancing place; so entrancing that Robert
Browning lived for some time at the Hand
Hotel, and the two famous “Ladies of Llangollen,”
Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby,
chose it out of all the world for their
life-long home. Llangollen is still dominated
by “the Ladies,” almost as much as by Dinas
Bran itself. They adorn the windows of all
its photograph shops; they shine in crude
colours from all its china mugs; and in its
churchyard we learn from an extremely ugly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
tombstone that one of them, in the opinion
of the other, had “manners worthy of her
Illustrious Birth.” It must be admitted that
such is not the impression given by the impartial.
It became the fashion for travellers
of mark to visit this quaint couple in their
house up there on the hill, and they themselves
insisted on its being also the fashion
to give them presents&mdash;carvings, miniatures,
curiosities of all kinds. If we care to climb
a steep hill we may see the outside of Plas
Newydd now, a black-and-white house, which
must have been really pretty in its original
simplicity, but is now overladen with a
mass of carving. From the road we can see
the porch in which “the Ladies” once stood
“fussing and tottering about in an agony of
expectation,” waiting for Sir Walter Scott,
and looking, says Lockhart, “like a couple
of hazy or crazy old sailors.” “Who could
paint,” he goes on, “the prints, the dogs, the
cats, the miniatures, the cram of cabinets,
clocks, glass-cases, books, bijouterie, dragon-china,
nodding mandarins, and whirligigs of
every shape and hue&mdash;the whole house outside
and in <i>covered</i> with carved oak ... and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the illustrated copies of Sir W.’s poems, and
the joking, simpering compliments about
Waverley.” But whether their manners were
worthy of their Illustrious Birth or not, they
were true friends to each other, and the
guardian angels, as Lockhart admits, of
Llangollen. It is an interesting fact (which
should not be forgotten) that the church
under whose shadow they lie is dedicated to
St. Collen ap Gwynnawg ap Clydawg ap
Cowrda ap Caradog Freichfras ap Llyr
Merimap Eini Yrth ap Cunedda Wledig.</p>

<p>Far more important than Plas Newydd
or its memories of vanished mandarins and
whirligigs is the work of that prince of
Powys, whose name I mentioned in connection
with Dinas Bran&mdash;Madoc ap Gryffyth
Maelor. In Pant-y-Groes, or the Valley of
the Cross, stands Madoc’s ruined abbey, the
most perfect retreat, surely, that ever brought
comfort to the sad or sinful. It was of the
Vale of Llangollen that Ruskin characteristically
wrote: “The whole valley, when once
I got up past the Works (whatever the
accursed business of them) seemed to me
entirely lovely in its gentle wildness.” And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
it is this very quality of gentle wildness that
gives such charm to the little Glen of the
Cross, which joins the larger valley of the
Dee just above Llangollen, and is reached
by way of the old stone bridge that was
the first of its kind in Wales.</p>

<p>When, in a few minutes, we see the gable
of Valle Crucis Abbey below us on the right,
we leave our car by the roadside. We leave,
indeed, the whole world behind us as we
pass through the heavy door by which there
was once no returning. The narrow wooded
valley hems us in, the trees are close round
us, the waters of the fishpond, in their
absolute stillness, add to the sense of aloofness
and peace. And under our very feet,
perhaps, is the dust of Iolo Goch, the famous
bard who sang of “Owain Glyndwr, the
great, the good”; for Iolo’s unmarked grave
is here; and here, too, lies Madoc, who built
this abbey in the last year of the twelfth
century; and Myfanwy, the beautiful princess,
“fairer than the cherry’s bloom”; and
others who died long, long before them.
To antiquarians the tombs of Valle Crucis
are full of interest, for there are some that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
seem to prove, says the custodian&mdash;himself
an antiquarian&mdash;that this Cistercian house
rose on the site of an older Benedictine
building. The Cistercians never used warlike
symbols, but always the sign of the Cross;
yet here on two stones of very early date&mdash;the
sixth or seventh century&mdash;are carved
the sword, the spear, and the battleaxe.
Fragments of stained glass, too, have been
unearthed, and coloured tiles, though the
Cistercian Rule forbade the use of colour
in any form. This austere Order, however,
while avoiding the use of the sword as a
symbol, was apparently not averse to using
it as a weapon on occasion, for it was by
fighting the Benedictines in a neighbouring
field, according to the custodian’s theory,
that they became possessed of the site of
their abbey. Truth to tell, the extreme
austerity of the Cistercians seems to have
relaxed in later days, for we hear after a
time of four courses of meat in silver dishes
at Valle Crucis, and of an abbot with three
of his fingers covered with rings. But these
are disturbing thoughts. Let us rather take
away with us a picture of the quiet fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>pond,
with its water-weeds and clumps of
yellow flags, and the gable of the church
reflected in it line for line, and on the bank
a hooded figure, dressed in white, with a
placid face and a busy fishing-rod.</p>

<p>Quite near the abbey in a field is a far
older relic, Eliseg’s Pillar, the rough stone
monument that gave its name to the Valley
of the Cross, though as a matter of fact
it was probably never a cross. It was once
much higher than it is now, but in the
days of the Civil War the name of the
valley was enough to make it <i>suspect</i>, and
the pillar was thrown down by the Puritans
on the chance of its once having been a
cross. It has been much discussed and disagreed
about, but at all events its very
great antiquity is a certainty, and the inscription
that is now illegible was luckily
copied several centuries ago. “Concenn,” it
tells us, “the great grandson of Eliseg,
erected this stone to the memory of his
great-grandfather, Eliseg. This is that Eliseg
who recovered his inheritance of Powis by
his sword from the power of the Angles.”</p>

<p>Returning to Llangollen we cross the Dee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
again and go on our way upon the road to
Holyhead, up the ridge of Rhysgog, past
Berwyn Station, and so out of the Vale of
Llangollen into that of Edeyrnion. The Dee
is still below us on the right, with thickly
wooded hills beyond it; and on the left are
rocky heights, sometimes bare and sometimes
softened by trees. We have a lovely
run before us down the valley, but if we
are prudent we will <i>drive slowly in the
neighbourhood of Corwen</i>.</p>

<p>But here, at the head of the valley, we
are eight miles away from Corwen, and
have other things to think of&mdash;great things,
indeed: the last struggle for Welsh freedom,
and the man who was the heart and
the head of it, that strange mixture of
ruthless vengeance and lovableness, Owen
Glyndwr, who as a pattern squire, rather
scholarly and very hospitable, spent many
quiet years, living sometimes here at Glyndyfrdwy
beside the Dee and sometimes at
his other house at Sycharth, and then suddenly,
at the touch of injustice, unfurled
the red dragon of Uther and became the
implacable devastator whose name meets us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
in every ruin in Wales. Nothing remains
now of his house, for Prince Hal descended
upon it one day, and, having left it level
with the ground, wrote to his “very dear
and entirely beloved” Wardens of the
Marches to tell them all about it. After
describing the burning of Sycharth and of
many houses round it he goes on: “Then
we went straight away to his other place
of Glyndourdy, to seek for him there.
There we burnt a fine lodge in his park,
and all the country round; and we remained
there all that night.” Above the spot where
the fine lodge stood is a curious tumulus
crowned with firs, quite close to the road.
It is known as Owen’s Mount, not because
he made it, for it is far older than he, but
because there is a story that he used it as
a kind of watch-tower. It was at Corwen,
some say, that he first raised his standard;
but the other memories of him here are
legendary and trivial.</p>

<p>From Corwen to wild Cerrig-y-Druidion&mdash;the
Rock of the Druids&mdash;the road rises
steadily, and leads to nothing of note but
the lovely little Pass of Glyndyffws, a deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
and narrow defile of sudden unexpected
beauty that connects two tracts of rather
dull country. Here, where the Ceirw flings
itself into the ravine from a great height
and foams among the rocks far below us,
Telford has thoughtfully supplied us with
several little recesses in the wall from which
to enjoy the view. I have heard that he
cut his name in the stone of one of them,
but I have never been able to find it.
Perhaps it was to his name that George
Borrow objected when he came here and
laughed at “Mr. T.” for being eager for
immortality. There was no need for Telford
to be over-anxious about his immortality;
nor yet, indeed, was there any for Borrow
to flout him because he was not a Welsh
bard!</p>

<p>Tyn-y-nant, where “little Dick Vickers,”
late of Shrewsbury Mail, hanged himself
rather exclusively, is a place of a dreary sort;
and so is Cerrig-y-Druidion; and so, most
of all, is the straight road from Cerrig to
Cernioge, a piece of road that catches all
the winds of heaven, and always seems
longer than it was last time. Open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
throttle here, and be thankful&mdash;if the weather
be cold&mdash;that your good engine is humming
before you, and is making a better pace than
the eleven miles an hour of which the shivering
travellers on this road used to boast.
Cernioge is to us merely an unkempt farmhouse,
but to them it meant a fire and hot
drinks, for it was once a posting-house of
considerable renown.</p>

<p>At Cernioge begins the descent into the
valley of the Conway; and it is here that
we first see, stretched out before us like
the Promised Land, the distant grandeur of
Snowdonia, the wild, impenetrable fortress
of the Welsh and the trap of the invading
English. When Pentre Voelas is passed the
beauty grows and grows, mile by mile, and
we are gently gliding down into the very
heart of it; wild crags to the right of us,
and before and below us a sea of woodland,
valley beyond valley and hill beyond hill.
There is one turn of the road where nearly
every car draws up. The valley of the
Conway lies at our feet, with here and
there the river shining through the trees;
the Lledr Valley stretches away and merges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
into the distant moors; Moel Siabod’s peak
rises at the end of it; and over Siabod’s
shoulder appears, on a clear day, a wedge-shaped
corner of Snowdon, faintly blue. I
have seen this view at many times of the
year, and the best time of all is May.</p>

<p>For the woods that are at our feet, the
woods that gave its name to Bettws-y-Coed,
the Chapel in the Wood, are at their best in
May, when every tree has its own individual
shade of colour, the larch its tender green,
and the budding oak its pink and gold. But,
indeed, Bettws is always lovely. Nothing
can spoil its innate simplicity; not even the
smart hats and parasols that look so incongruous
in its little street in July and August.
It exists only for tourists; there are several
good hotels, and, roughly speaking, all the
other houses are lodgings; yet in spite of
all, Bettws is a village still. Those who like
to settle down comfortably and motor round
a centre, instead of touring from place to
place, will find this much the most central
and convenient spot from which to explore
North Wales. And in any case, I think we
must stay here for a night or two. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
must drive to Rhuddlan and Conway and
Dolwyddelan; we must stand on the Pont-y-Pair
and watch the tempestuous Llugwy;
we must inspect David Cox’s famous signboard
at the Royal Oak; and in the evening,
when the dusky yews are all in shadow, we
must sit in the churchyard beside the Conway,
where the great artist loved to paint.
The church&mdash;the “Chapel in the Wood”&mdash;is
uncouth and bare, and not improved by
modern windows; but it has stood here for
many centuries, and among its ugly pews
we realise with a thrill that the tomb at
our feet holds the dust of a prince of
Llewelyn’s house.</p>

<div class="center">

<img id="ill19" src="images/ill19.jpg" width="440" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE LLUGWY AT BETTWS-Y-COED.</p></div>

<p>This is the country of Llewelyn the Great.
On one side of us is the valley that tradition
names as his birthplace; on the other the
valley where he was buried. His grave we
cannot see, for his burial-place at Aberconwy
was desecrated when Edward I. built his
great castle; but on the way from Bettws to
Rhuddlan we may pause at the church of
Llanrwst and see there, on the floor of
Inigo Jones’s chapel of the Wynnes, the
coffin of stone that once held the bones of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the greatest of the Welsh princes. There
are a good many interesting things here&mdash;things
much older than the church itself;
but not the least pleasing, I think, is the
Latin epitaph that the former rector composed,
with a pretty wit, for his own tomb.
It has been thus translated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">“Once the undeserving schoolmaster,</div>
<div class="i0">Then the more undeserving lecturer,</div>
<div class="i0">Last of all the most undeserving rector of this parish.</div>
<div class="i0">Do not think, speak, or write anything evil of the dead.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>If we are going to Rhuddlan it will not
be necessary for us to cross the shaking
bridge, designed&mdash;perhaps&mdash;by Inigo Jones.
I see no object in a bridge shaking, myself,
but there are always those at hand
who for a consideration will shake you the
bridge if it gives you pleasure. Our way,
however, lies to the right, up a winding hill
three miles in length, with an average
gradient of 1 in 12. It is a serious climb;
but the backward view of the mountain
range beyond the Conway is magnificent&mdash;a
view of rather a rare quality, and not often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
seen by those who depend upon horses’
legs or their own. The road that crosses
the top of the hills runs through scenery
of rather a commonplace type; then, as we
drop down into Abergele the Morfa Rhuddlan
lies before us like a map&mdash;a dull map&mdash;with
fashionable Rhyl in the distance; and
from Abergele to Rhuddlan the road is surely
the straightest and flattest that ever was seen.</p>

<p>The ivy-smothered towers of Rhuddlan
Castle stand on the banks of the Clwyd.
That great statesman and soldier, Edward I.,
being weary of the “Welsh Question,”
determined to get the affair finished once
for all; so he rebuilt this castle, settled
down here with his Court and family, conquered
the country, made its laws, and saw
that they were carried out. There is a
remnant still standing of the house where
he held his parliament and “secured its independence
to the Principality of Wales.”
These words, though not Edward’s, are quite
in the spirit of his little jokes. It was here
that he played his historical practical joke
upon the Welsh nation, when he promised
them a prince who was a native of Wales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
and could not speak a word of English&mdash;and
then showed them the baby. There is
nothing for us to see inside this castle, for
Cromwell altogether dismantled it, and its
heavy green towers, though impressive
enough as being the grave of Welsh independence,
are not nearly so typical of the
“ruthless king” as his great fortresses of
Carnarvon and Harlech and Conway.</p>

<p>Conway is only seventeen miles away, and
we may see it on our return journey to Bettws,
by driving back to Abergele, where there is
a nice old posting-house, and thence passing
on above Colwyn Bay. Five hundred years
ago another traveller came by this way
from Conway: a poor, duped, heart-sick king
riding helplessly to imprisonment and mysterious
death. It was at Conway that
Bolingbroke’s messenger Northumberland, a
man of a most treacherous heart, met
Richard II. with solemn vows of friendship;
and along this coast that they rode together,
still smiling, the knave and the fool,
to Rhuddlan and Flint, where Bolingbroke’s
army lay waiting on the sands o’ Dee.
Those splendid walls and towers of Conway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
that we see beyond the estuary, piled high
above the water-side, were Richard II.’s last
refuge. From that day forward every roof
that sheltered him was a prison.</p>

<p>All through the history of Wales this
estuary has played an important part.
Long, long before Edward’s magnificent
towers rose over the desecrated burial-place
of the great Llewelyn there was a castle
guarding the river-mouth at Deganwy. We
can see its fragments still if we choose to
drive round that way before crossing to
Conway; but there is only a remnant left, a
few stones on a hillside facing the sea&mdash;stones
that tell of Maelgwyn of the sixth century,
and of Norman Robert, lord of Rhuddlan,
who rebuilt Maelgwyn’s fortress and met
his death there, and of King John of
England, who was starved out by the
Welsh. Robert of Rhuddlan’s death was
picturesque, and, I imagine, well deserved.
This was the manner of it. He was still
employed in rebuilding the Welsh castle of
Deganwy for the harrying of the people to
whom it really belonged, when one day he
fell asleep&mdash;a rash thing to do in those days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
and in that place. Then came Griffith,
Prince of Gwynedd, with his ships, and
stole all Robert’s cattle, and was just setting
sail again when Robert awoke and saw
what was going forward. Down this steep
bank below the castle he dashed to the
shore, and fought desperately, with only one
follower to support him; but soon died, of
course, by the spears of the Welsh. Griffith
nailed his head to the mast and sailed away;
then, when the Normans chased him, flung
it into the sea before their eyes.</p>

<p>As for King John, when he in his turn
tried to strengthen the fortress of Deganwy,
he was glad enough to escape with his wicked
head on his shoulders. He had come into
Wales “minded to destroy all that had life
within the country”; but he departed, we
are told, in a great fury, leaving a large
proportion of his army behind him for
Llewelyn to bury. For the Welsh had cut
off all the supplies of the English, “so that
in time they were glad to take up with horseflesh
or anything, were it never so mean,
which might fill up their greedy and empty
stomachs.” So says Caradoc of Llancarvan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Other historians give us a letter written on
the spot by a certain knight, a man of parts,
of whose life and letters one would like to
know more. He describes the royal army
as “watching, fasting, praying, and freezing.
We watch,” he continues, “for fear of the
Welsh.... We fast for want of provisions....
We pray that we may speedily return
safe and scot-free home; and we freeze for
want of winter garments, having but a thin
linen shirt to keep us from the wind.” This
vivid letter-writer goes on to tell us of the
spoiling of Aberconwy Abbey and the burning
of all the valuable old Welsh records
there, and he shows a good deal of nice
feeling in the matter.</p>

<p>It was on the ruins of Aberconwy that
Edward’s glorious castle rose later on to
overawe the Welsh. This Castle of Conway
is the most beautiful of all Henry de Elfreton’s
works, I think; more beautiful in itself
even than Harlech; and we can well believe,
as we drive across the bridge and under the
great machicolated town gate, that in early
days it could only be taken by the help of
guile or famine. Glyndwr’s men won their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
way in by disguising one of their number
as a carpenter, and to dislodge them Hotspur,
finding his engines useless, was obliged
to starve them out. During the Civil War
the castle was held for the King by the
Archbishop of York, an extremely “muscular
Christian,” who on being superseded in
his command felt the slight so deeply that
he joined Mytton the Roundhead, and himself
led the assault! And these great walls,
fifteen feet in thickness, yielded at last. As
one climbs the long flight of steps to the
entrance with all these things in one’s mind
there is something almost overwhelming in
the grandeur of these strong towers.</p>

<p>“A very neat castle,” says Camden.</p>

<p>When we have had our luncheon at the
Castle Hotel we must cross the road to
Plas Mawr, the town house of the Wynnes
of Gwydir, who entertained Queen Elizabeth
there more than once, and even decorated
her rooms with appropriate symbols, royal
arms, and monograms. The plaster mouldings
in this house are its special feature:
fireplaces, ceilings, walls, all are ornamented
with them, and in each room the design is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
different. One cannot, however, enjoy the
mouldings and the oak furniture and the
priests’ hiding-hole and the lantern window
with an undivided mind, for the Plas Mawr
ghost&mdash;unconventional soul!&mdash;walks by daylight.</p>

<p class="caption">THE PASS OF NANT FFRANCON.</p></div>

<p>We leave Conway by the road that
follows the western bank of the river, for
by so doing we secure an impressive backward
view of the old town walls, which
is ample compensation for the steep ascent
that soon carries us out of sight. Moreover
this road, after a few more hills and
a few more miles of level going, with a
view up the valley that grows lovelier
every moment, will lead us to Trefriew, a
dear little watering-place with a good
hotel. The tiny church here has no outward
attractions; it has not even any
appearance of age. Yet it has its own
romance; for it is said that when the
English wife of Llewelyn the Great&mdash;Joan,
the daughter of King John&mdash;found the
severe climb to the old church of Llanrhychwyn
too much for her, her thoughtful
husband built this one for her at the foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
of the hill. Those who do not share her
feelings may still see, on the heights
above the village, the yet older church
where Llewelyn worshipped before his
wife objected to the walk. And beyond it
again, on the wild hill-top, is Llyn
Geirionydd, on whose shores lived Taliesin,
the Bard of the Radiant Brow, the most
famous of all the Welsh bards.</p>

<p>Between Trefriew and Bettws there are
but a few miles of level road and very
lovely scenery. Gwydir Castle, the old
house of the Wynnes, stands between us
and the river, and may be seen when
Lord Carrington is away. It is full, I
believe, of carvings and tapestry and relics
of history. Queen Elizabeth stayed here,
and Leicester, and Charles I.</p>

<p>But here among these wild Welsh hills
Elizabeth’s starched ruff and Charles’s
curls strike one as a little out of place.
We may find memories of Elizabeth&mdash;who
seems to have slept in as many different
places as a motorist&mdash;in half the towns
and big houses of England. This is the
country of the Kings of Gwynedd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>We saw the Lledr Valley stretched out
before us as we came down the hill from
Pentre Voelas to Bettws. But that bird’s-eye
view of it gives one no idea at all of
its extreme beauty; of the towering height
of its steep slopes, now bare and rocky,
now richly wooded: of its brilliant colouring
and deep purple shadows. At the head
of it, where its beauty is partly spoiled
by quarries and all their works, is Dolwyddelan
village; and beyond that again,
standing alone among the desolate hills,
is the stern tower where Llewelyn the
Great, the “eagle of men,” is believed to
have been born. It is only a square
tower now, and though it once had two
towers it was never a place of any size;
for Dolwyddelan and Dolbadarn, the two
mountain strongholds of the princes of
Gwynedd, did not rely upon their own
strength, but on the great bewildering
hills that defended them on every side.
Thus it was that this small fortress was
the last to yield to Edward I. And while
remembering Llewelyn here do not let us
forget to dedicate one sigh to his poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
father, Iorwerth Drwyndwn&mdash;of the broken
nose&mdash;who, when that unfortunate feature
kept him from his princedom, was given
this country and its tower by way of
compensation.</p>

<p>It is the custom to return to Bettws
from this point, for reasons that a glance
at the Contour Book may perhaps explain.
But the fashion has been set, I
think, by bicyclists, whom one really cannot
blame for shirking the hill that rises between
Dolwyddelan and Maentwrog. Here let me
assure motorists that there is little reason
why they should miss the wild beauty of
the moors above this point; the rolling
expanse of brown and purple bogland, the
endless succession of hills, the grand outline
of Moel Siabod. For though the road is
certainly steep the surface is excellent, except
for a mile or so above Blaenau Festiniog,
that strange town on the mountain ledge
that entirely owes its existence to the
neighbouring quarries, and yet is more
than a mile long and has three railway
stations. There is no need to brave the
hill again to return to Bettws, for the road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
by Maentwrog, Penrhyndeudraeth, and the
Pass of Aberglaslyn is one of the loveliest
in Wales, and though we shall come down
the Pass by and by there is no hardship in
going over the ground twice. It is worth
remembering, too, that at Maentwrog it is
possible, if time allows, to cross the valley
and approach the famous toy railway-line
at its prettiest point, Tan-y-Bwlch, where a
lake lies hidden among the woods, and
where we may have tea on the grass close
beside the water, facing a scene of rich
colouring and deep, cool shadows.</p>

<p>All this, however, is a digression. It is
highly probable that the great majority
of motorists will look at the Contour Book
and return to Bettws from Dolwyddelan.
They will have the advantage of seeing
the Lledr Valley from a new point of view.</p>

<p>Now in the Snowdon country there are
three great passes through the mountains
to the sea: the Passes of Nant Ffrancon,
Llanberis, and Nant Gwynant combined
with Aberglaslyn. It is hard to say which
is the most beautiful of the three; and it
is quite imperative, and also quite easy, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
see them all by pursuing rather a zigzag
course. Nant Ffrancon is the route of the
Holyhead Road and the nearest to Bettws:
so we will go down by Nant Ffrancon, and
come up again by Llanberis on the same
day; and on the next start off again by
way of Nant Gwynant and Aberglaslyn,
passing through Bedd Gelert.</p>

<p>The road climbs out of Bettws through a
thick wood beside the rushing Llugwy, and
soon draws near the Swallow Falls.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This
triple fall is only a stone’s-throw from the
road, and it is worth while to follow the
slippery path across the pine-needles, and
stand for a moment in the pricking spray
watching the commotion. In the thick of
the hubbub they say the spirit of Sir John
Wynne, which left this mortal coil early
in the seventeenth century, is being
“purged, punished, and spouted upon”;
though I have never heard anything
definite against him except that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
“shrewd and successful.” He was a member
of that Court of the Marches of which
we heard so much at Ludlow, and he left
a very valuable record of his family behind
him.</p>

<p>This bit of country between Bettws
and Capel Curig is one of the gems of
North Wales. Moel Siabod towers above
us; and beyond it soon appears that cloud-capped
peak whose name quickens every
Welsh heart&mdash;the rallying-point of heroes,
the symbol and stronghold of the liberties
of Wales. The finest view of Snowdon is
from Capel Curig, where the double peak
is reflected in the double lake.</p>

<p>Our road, still climbing, turns to the
right in Capel Curig and takes us up into
the heart of the hills, through a scene of
splendid desolation&mdash;bare heights, huge
boulders tossed and heaped upon the
ground, jagged outlines, and dark sullen
colours&mdash;a land that was vastly disconcerting
to those travellers of an earlier day
whose idea of beauty was “a smiling
landscape.” As we reach the summit and
see the waters of Llyn Ogwen below us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
sapphire-blue or lead-grey according to
circumstances, the great sides of Tryfaen
and the Glydyrs tower on the left. Beyond
the lake Alla Wen rises steeply. “A horrid
spot of hills,” says a seventeenth-century
writer. “The most dreadful horse-path in
Wales,” says Pennant; and that indeed it
may well have been before Telford came
here to perform his miracles of engineering.
“The district through which the
surveys were carried is mountainous,” he
says quietly; “and I found the existing
roads very imperfect.” When we have
passed Llyn Ogwen, and the cottage where
food is to be had if necessary, and the
sudden turning over the bridge, and are
swinging down the gentle slope of Nant
Ffrancon high up on the mountain-side,
we must surely give nearly as much
admiration to this road which descends for
ten miles with no steeper gradient than
1 in 15 as we give to the wide Valley of
the Beavers below us. Above us the
mountain is a mass of grey boulders, of
scars and landslips; below us it sweeps
down precipitously to where the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Ogwen dances like a streak of quicksilver.
Presently we pass under the hideous
excrescence of the Penrhyn slate quarries,
grey terraces of rubbish contrasting cruelly
with the glowing gorse of the opposite
slopes; and then through the equally
hideous town of slate, Bethesda, the miners’
town, whose slate walls, slate steps, and
slate porches are enough, as Dr. Johnson,
would say, “to make a man hang himself.”
Let us hurry on into the Cochwillan
Woods.</p>

<p>Very soon after passing the modern towers
of Penrhyn Castle we reach the town of
Bangor, “which for the beauty of its
situation, was called Ban-cor, the high
or conspicuous choir.” It is not a very inviting
place, nevertheless, and there is no
need to pause here, for even the cathedral
is not beautiful. It has had a great deal to
bear; for it was burnt by Harold the Saxon,
and again by King John, and again by
Owen Glyndwr; and no doubt the castle
built by Hugh, Earl of Chester, suffered on
one or all of these occasions, for Camden
says, “though he made diligent inquiry he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
could not discover the least footsteps” of
it. The original cathedral was founded by
St. Deiniol in the sixth century, and beneath
it is buried the great Welsh prince Owen
Gwynedd, hero of many battles, who fought
here on the heights above the straits a fight
so desperate that “the Menai could not
ebb on account of the torrent of blood
which flowed into it.” Before we go on to
Carnarvon we must cross those straits, for
the sake of the bridge, and of the view,
and of Beaumaris.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1826 that the mail-coach,
swaying under its burden of excited
officials, rolled slowly for the first time
over the Menai Bridge. It was a brave
scene. Telford, in his modest way, had
pleaded against a formal procession, but he
could not check personal enthusiasm nor
prevent the mustering of that long, long
line of carriages and horsemen and thousands
on foot, which followed the Royal London
and Holyhead Mail, amid the fluttering of
flags and the firing of guns, and the roaring
of a gale. Nor yet could he control the
shouts that rose above the wind when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
himself passed by in an inconspicuous
carriage.</p>

<p>As soon as we reach the sacred shore of
Mona, the last home of the Druids, we turn
sharply to the right; unless, indeed, we have
a mind to pursue the Holyhead road for a
couple of miles, for the pleasure of telling our
friends that we have seen Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerchwryndrobwllantysiliogogogoch.
I
once heard a rumour that this place was
to be connected by rail with Pontrhydfendigaedmynachlogfawr,
but as the scheme may
come to nothing perhaps it would be wiser not
to mention it.</p>

<p>From the shore road to Beaumaris we see
the whole grand panorama of the Gwynedd
mountains, height beyond height and range
beyond range, from the pale distant peak of
Snowdon to the dark shadows of steep Penmaenmawr.
It is a scene that has a quality
of strangeness in it. One looks at it from
the outside, as it were; for Anglesey, which
once was green with the sacred groves of
the Druids, is now, as it was in the days
of Giraldus Cambrensis, “an arid and stony
land, rough and unpleasant in its appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>ance.”
One feels, on this flat shore, worlds
away from that beautiful country beyond
the strait. On a day of sunshine and cloud,
when the mountains are glowing with every
imaginable colour and seem every moment
to be changing their shapes under the
moving shadows, it is worth driving many
a mile to sit on the beach of Beaumaris.</p>

<p>Behind us, close at hand, is Beaumaris
Castle; opposite to us, across the water, is
“Aber of the white shells,” where Llewelyn
the Great held his Court, and where his
English wife died; and a little further along
the Anglesey shore to our left is Llanfaes,
where he buried her “with dire lamentation
and no little honour,” and built over her grave
a monastery that was altogether destroyed
by Henry IV. Poor Joan’s coffin must have
been through many changes before the sad
day when it occurred to some thrifty farmer
that the queer old stone trough would do
finely for his cattle to drink out of. It was
fortunately discovered early in the last century,
and another watering-trough having
been found for the cows, it was placed in
safety in the garden at Baron Hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>Beaumaris Castle does not make so brave
a show as most of Edward’s fortresses; but
its ten low towers and its double line of
defence were no doubt formidable enough
before their thick drapery of ivy gave them
so soft an air. The rusty iron rings that
hang on the outer wall give one of those
little touches of the commonplace that bring
the past so near. Edward I. cut a canal
and filled the moat of Beaumaris Castle
from the sea, and so the ships that brought
supplies to the garrison were moored and
unladed at the very walls.</p>

<p>The shores of the Menai have seen a vast
amount of fighting of a very desperate kind,
from the days when the Druids stood at bay
here to the time when Edward I. bridged
the strait with boats and was badly beaten
by the last Llewelyn. And as we re-cross
the bridge and look down at the ancient
little church of Llandysilio so far below us,
we may remember another scene&mdash;peaceful
in itself but not unconnected with bloodshed&mdash;when
on a hill near here, Archbishop
Baldwin and that delightful chronicler
Giraldus induced many persons, by persuasive
discourses, to “take the cross.”</p>

<p class="caption">CARNARVON CASTLE.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>From the other side of the Menai, on the
Carnarvon road, the view is, of course, comparatively
tame; but we have only eight
miles to travel before reaching Carnarvon,
and on a level road they are soon disposed
of.</p>

<p>It is difficult to realise at the first
moment that the well-preserved, clean walls
upon which one comes so suddenly in
the middle of Carnarvon were raised by
Edward I.; though that king himself stands
above the gateway, with his hand on the
sword that worked so hard. This is the
greatest of his castles; he chose it for
the birthplace of his son, and chose it too,
apparently, to be the monument and symbol
of himself. Nothing could be a more fitting
emblem of the unyielding strength of the
king who built castles in Wales almost as
profusely as other men build them in Spain.
On this, the town side of it, one is more
struck with its strength than with its
beauty. To see it at its best one must
cross the bridge, and from the other side
of the river-mouth look at the huge bulk
of it; the long line of the curtain-wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
reflected in the water; the great octagonal
towers, with their clusters of slender turrets;
the unutterable repellent air of it. There
are no windows in these cold walls; no ivy
or very little, to soften their austerity.
Even from this side, though the water and
the shipping give it picturesque surroundings,
I think Carnarvon Castle is not beautiful
so much as impressive. When Queen
Eleanor entered it through the gate still
called the Queen’s she did not see it as it
stands now, for it was finished by her son,
who was born in the castle soon after her
arrival. A little room in the Eagle Tower
is shown as his birthplace; but those who
have read the local records declare it to be
proved beyond doubt that the tower was
without a roof till the baby in question,
Edward II., put a roof on it himself.</p>

<p>It is surprisingly well preserved. This, no
doubt, is partly because it has never been
overcome by any more destructive agent than
the starvation of its garrison. Glyndwr
besieged it on its landward side, and his
French allies attacked it from the sea; but
they made little impression upon it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
finally, since time was precious, they thought
it wiser to employ their engines elsewhere
more profitably, though the garrison within
numbered only twenty-eight men, in sore
want of provisions.</p>

<p>Between Carnarvon and the Pass of
Llanberis lie ten miles of undulating
country. But the mountains are towering
before us like an impassable wall, growing
ever higher and more formidable as we pass
Llyn Padarn and Llanberis town, whence
the mountain-railway starts for the summit
of Snowdon. No doubt the northern shores
of Llyn Padarn and of Llyn Peris, which
lies beyond it, were once beautiful; but
they are now merely a mass of unsightly
débris, mountains of broken slate, terrace
above terrace of melancholy grey. The
southern shore of Llyn Peris, however, at
the very foot of the Pass, has kept its
own wild beauty, and on a craggy little
hill that rises at the lower end “there is
yet a pece of a toure,” as Leland says.
A very notable piece of a tower it is too;
for Dolbadarn was the very centre and
heart and ultimate citadel of Welsh free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>dom
from the earliest days. Here Llewelyn,
the third and last, kept his brother a
prisoner for twenty-three years, and here
Owen Glyndwr hid himself whenever it
suited him to elude the English, who invariably
lost their way among these mountains.
It was here, too, that Owen hid his
chief enemy, Lord Grey of Ruthin, who
had embroiled him with the King of
England and caused all the trouble. But
this little square grey “pece of a toure”
is far older, they say, than Owen or
Llewelyn. It is supposed to have been
built by Maelgwyn, the same prince
who built that first castle at Deganwy
which was rebuilt by Robert of Rhuddlan
and King John at such large cost to themselves.
Maelgwyn, King of Gwynedd in the
sixth century, is one of the forceful
characters who stand out here and there
conspicuously in the rather bewildering host
of Cymric princes; a personable man, according
to all accounts, and one of great courage
and success in battle, yet not without leanings
towards the monastic life. He actually
became a monk for a time; but no one can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
have been greatly surprised when he tired
of the constraint and took to soldiering
again. On the whole I fear he was a
truculent creature, for Taliesin, “chief of
the bards of the West,” proclaimed, with
the ambiguity common to prophets, that&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">“A most strange creature should come from the sea-marsh of Rhianedd</div>
<div class="i0">As a punishment of iniquity on Maelgwn Gywnedd,</div>
<div class="i0">His hair, his teeth, and his eyes being as gold.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And Maelgwyn died of the yellow plague.</p>

<p class="caption">SNOWDON, FROM CAPEL CURIG.</p></div>

<p>It is only a little way beyond this point
that the actual Pass of Llanberis begins to
rise, cleaving its straight course between the
mountains to the very foot of Snowdon&mdash;“to
the Welsh always the hill of hills,” as
Borrow says. The highest peak, Y Wyddfa,
is not visible from the Pass, but one
sharp-edged shoulder in certain lights
seems to be within a stone’s-throw of the
road. This is the steepest of the three
passes near Snowdon, and the one whose
name is best known to the world in
general. As for beauty&mdash;the most beautiful
of the three is the one on whose royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
blues and imperial purples one’s eyes are
actually feasting at the moment. But I
would say this: to understand even the
elements of the beauty of these hills it is
imperative to travel <i>up</i> each of the three
passes, for as one climbs up into the heart
of the mountains the effect is in every
case more beautiful than on the downward
journey. On a continuous tour this is of
course impossible; and that is one reason
why the best way of seeing Snowdonia is
to stay for a few days at a centre, such as
Bettws, or Capel Curig, or Pen-y-Gwryd.</p>

<p>At one or other of the two latter places
it will probably be necessary to spend a
night after this run from Bettws to Bangor
and Carnarvon. Capel Curig has the finer
view, and a hotel that has overlooked Llyn
Mymbyr and faced the peaks of Snowdon
for many a year. I do not know if it is
the same that Sir Walter Scott stayed in
and Lockhart described as “a pretty little
inn in a most picturesque situation
certainly, and as to the matter of toasted
cheese, quite exquisite”; but it is without
doubt the same that seemed to George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Borrow “a very magnificent edifice.” He
dined here, he tells us, “in a grand
saloon amidst a great deal of fashionable
company,” who “surveyed him with looks
of the most supercilious disdain.” I strongly
suspect that both the fashion and the disdain
existed only in a sensitive imagination.</p>

<p>Pen-y-Gwryd is exactly at the junction
of the Pass of Llanberis with Nant
Gwynant, the valley down which our
future course lies; and here too there is a
comfortable inn, with memories of Charles
Kingsley and the author of “Tom Brown’s
Schooldays.” From this point we can start
off in the morning without retracing a step.</p>

<p>As one glides down the perfect gradient
of this entrancing valley of the Glaslyn,
with the very blue waters of Llyn Gwynant
glittering below and the sides of Snowdon
rising precipitously from the shore on the
right, and on the left the wild green slopes
climbing up and up from the roadside to
the sky, one comes after all to a decision
as to the comparative beauty of these
passes. Nant Gwynant is the best. The
hill is three miles and a half long, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
some places just steep enough to force us
to slacken speed and so make the most of
our surroundings; then a few miles of
undulating road lead past Llyn Dinas and,
still by the side of the stony Glaslyn, into
the village of Bedd Gelert, which has won
fame on false grounds as the burial-place
of Llewelyn’s hound. The rough, pathetic
tomb, that stands in a meadow and is
reached by a path made by the feet
of thousands of pilgrims, has a most
plausible appearance; but it was, I believe,
raised by the forethought of a hotel-keeper&mdash;a
man who apparently knew his
world. No bones of a faithful dog lie
here; but if we may not weep over the
dust of Gelert we may at all events mourn
the loss of a beautiful, but dead, legend.
We drive through the village and enter,
almost at once, the Pass of Aberglaslyn.
The steep part of the road is quite short;
but this strange cleft in the rock, this
narrow ravine that holds only the river
and the road between its cliffs, forms an
imposing southern gate to the Snowdon
mountains. We pass out of it almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
suddenly into the wide, level meadowland
of the Traeth Mawr&mdash;and may the gorse be
in its full glory at the time!</p>

<p>This plain that we are swinging across
so happily, this plain of green and gold,
was a barren marsh, useless to man or
beast, till it was reclaimed in the early
part of last century by a certain Mr.
Maddox, who gave his name to the two
towns that own their existence to him&mdash;Portmadoc
and Tremadoc. At Tremadoc
lived Percy and Harriet Shelley for a little
time, while they were still happy. The
poet, with characteristic enthusiasm, was
fascinated by the great draining-scheme;
and in his leisure moments grounded poor
Harriet in Latin.</p>

<p>It is here or at Portmadoc that we turn
to the right, if we are minded, to explore
the little-known peninsula of Lleyn. For
some mysterious reason the greater part of
this promontory is seldom visited, though it
is not by any means without attractions.
It cannot, of course, compare in any respect
with the dramatic grandeur of the Snowdon
country; there are large tracts that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
might even be called uninteresting; but
from the southern uplands the panorama
of the mountains of Gwynedd is really
magnificent, and on the northern coast the
fine outline of Yr Eifl&mdash;ridiculously corrupted
into the Rivals&mdash;rises very grandly from
the sea. And when the gorse is in blossom
the whole country is veined with gold, for
here they make their hedges of gorse, and
the air is heavy with its poignant
sweetness.</p>

<p>As for the roads, they are mostly good.
The roads from Pwllheli to Nevin, to Yr
Eifl and Clynnogfawr, and to Aberdaron
are all excellent; so also is the one that
connects Nevin with Aberdaron; but the
“Saints’ Road to Bardsey” from Nevin to
Llanaellraiarn should be avoided, since the
saints, apparently, employed indifferent
engineers.</p>

<p>To reach Pwllheli from Portmadoc we
must past through Criccieth, one of the
most popular places on this coast, and one
that must have been really beautiful before
its popularity spoilt it. It has a nice hotel,
and is, in any case, a far more attractive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
stopping-place than the ambitious Pwllheli.
The castle, not without dignity, stands aloof
upon its abrupt round promontory, facing
the rows of modern lodging-house as though
they were some new kind of enemy drawn
up against it. For that Edwardian gateway
has faced many enemies, and the castle still
more. Of its original founding I believe
nothing is certainly known, but it is older
than its gateway, for Llewelyn the Great
chose it for the prison of his unruly son,
Gryffydd, of whom it was said that
“peace was not to be looked for in his
neighbourhood.” But, indeed, in those times
a strong prison seems to have been the
only way of securing peace in any one’s
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Much the most picturesque person who
has ever been connected with Criccieth
was Sir Howel y Fwyall, or <i>of the Axe</i>.
So doughty were his deeds at Poictiers
that the Black Prince not only did him
honour in the usual ways, with money and
knighthood, but gave orders that the pole-axe
with which he had done so valiantly
should be set up in this castle of Criccieth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>&mdash;of
which Howel was Constable&mdash;and
should be served with a mess of meat
daily. Eight yeoman were entrusted with
this service, and after the ceremony the
meat was given to the poor. The custom
was kept up till the reign of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The name of Pwllheli is well known, if ill-pronounced,
in the world of tourists. It
aspires to be a fashionable watering-place,
and one feels that success may possibly
crown its endeavours, when one considers
the natural disadvantages of Rhyl and Borth
and many another prosperous spot.</p>

<p>A few years ago we should have been
obliged, having once passed Criccieth, to
spend the night at Pwllheli; but now we
shall do well if we rather choose Nevin for
our stopping-place. A nice new hotel has
been built there&mdash;a hotel with no foolish
pretensions, but evidently with every intention
of gradually becoming a thoroughly
comfortable abiding-place for golfers who
like quietness. The little town lies close
under the shelter of the hills, and between
it and the sea is the flat land of the Morfa
Nevin, where Edward I. gathered all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
chivalry of England and many a foreign
noble to celebrate his conquest of Wales in
a great tournament.</p>

<p>Nevin is threatened with the railway,
which, if it actually approaches the place,
will certainly spoil it; but it will be long,
I imagine, before any intrusion of that kind
disturbs the peace or injures the beauty of
little Aberdaron. It is an elect spot, this
End of the World in Wales; more remote,
less visited than St. David’s, and infinitely
less famous; yet once trodden, like St.
David’s, by the weary feet of countless
pilgrims. For just beyond that low headland
on our right is sacred Bardsey, the
Island of the Saints, where lies the dust
of twenty thousand holy men. St.
Mary’s Abbey, of which some fragments
still are left, was founded in such early
days that Dubritius, who crowned King
Arthur and then resigned the See of
Caerleon to St. David, came to end his
day in this remote monastery; and so holy
was the soil at last that every monk in
Wales crossed this dangerous channel to
kneel upon it. It was here, from these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
wide, white sands of Aberdaron, that they
embarked, half trembling, half inspired&mdash;white-robed
Cistercians and sombre Benedictines&mdash;and
here, in this little church
between the hills and the sea, that they
spent the night on their knees before braving
dangers that were not by any means
imaginary. The building has been re-roofed
and much restored, but these are the very
walls within which the pilgrims prayed, the
very walls that once gave sanctuary to any
man, innocent or guilty, who sought their
shelter. The blind wall on the north bears
witness to the early British origin of the
church.</p>

<p>And we must not forget, as we stand
thinking of the pilgrim monks on the
shore, that this sheltered, isolated corner,
hidden closely by the hills on the one side
and protected by the long headlands on the
other, was once visited by secular history.
Into this bay sailed Hotspur’s father, the
base Northumberland, from France, and
from Harlech came Owen Glyndwr and
Edmund Mortimer; and here in the house
of the lord of Aberdaron they swore to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
thenceforward “bound by the bond of a
true league and true friendship and sure and
good union,” and to act in all ways as
became “good true and faithful friends to
good true and faithful friends.”</p>

<p>The fascinations of the Bay of Aberdaron,
however, must not blind us to the fact that
the finest scenery in the Peninsula, of Lleyn,
is in the north. From Pwllheli we should
drive across to Llanaellraiarn under the
great brow of Yr Eifl, and then, turning
to the right, follow the road between the
wild, craggy hills and the sea to Clynnogfawr.
Here lived and died the great St. Beuno,
and the church that bears his name is of
a size and importance quite unusual in so
tiny a place: “almost as bigge as St.
Davides,” says Leland. This large church
only dates from the fifteenth century, but
the little chapel where St. Beuno is buried
is connected with it by a covered way, and
was founded by the saint himself in the
seventh century. His tomb was still to be
seen in Pennant’s day, and had the gift of
working miracles, but now both monument
and miracles are no more. In the larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
church is carefully preserved a strange old
chest that is said to have belonged to St.
Beuno.</p>

<p>To reach the Traeth Mawr from Clynnog
our best way is to go on to Pont-y-Croes,
then strike across to Pen-y-Groes, and
thence descend to Tremadoc. There is not
much to be said in favour of this road’s
surface, but the beauty of it increases every
moment, and for the last few miles, as we drop
gently down on to that plain of gorse that
lies like a sheet of flame between two ranges
of purple mountains, we have as fine a sight
above, below, and before us as any we shall
find in Wales. A few minutes later we are
in Portmadoc, and from the long embankment
there look up the valley of the
Glaslyn across the Traeth Mawr to that
gate of Gwynedd through which we came
a little while ago.</p>

<p>Presently we cross the estuary of the
river Dwryd by a toll-bridge. I think this
river-bank must be the scene of a touching
incident described by Giraldus. He and his
Archbishop, recruiting for the Crusades, were
met “at the passage of a bridge” between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the Traeth Mawr and Llanbedr near Harlech
by Meredyth ap Conan, a prince of this
country. He brought with him a large
suite, and then and there by the river-side
the Archbishop preached to them, and “many
persons were signed with the Cross.” Among
these ardent souls was a personal friend of
the young prince. Meredyth, seated higher
on the bank than his suite, looked on
while the symbolic cross was sewn upon
the cloaks of the new crusaders, till it came
to the turn of his own friend. Then Meredyth,
says Giraldus, “observing that the
cloak on which the cross was to be sewn
was of too thin and too common a texture,
with a flood of tears threw him down his
own.”</p>

<p>From the banks of the Dwryd a very level
road soon brings us within sight of Harlech.
It is a very distant glimpse of it that we
have first; an irregular outline, a grey mass
of towers standing out against the sky,
raised grandly upon a rock above a plain
that is nearly as flat as the sea beyond it.
Then trees hide it, and we climb through
the woods to the level of the great gate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
before which so many armies have stood
before us&mdash;armies of Owen and of Henry, of
Edward IV., and of Oliver.</p>

<p class="caption">GATEWAY OF HARLECH CASTLE.</p></div>

<p>Long, long before Henry de Elfreton, king
of architects, built this grand fortress at
Edward’s command, a royal castle stood upon
this rock. So, at least, says one of the
“Mabinogion,” and here, under the spell of
the land that created those old romances,
I would fain believe that Branwen, the
daughter of Llyr, lived at Harlech with her
royal brother Bendigeid Vran, and that
Matholwch, King of Ireland, came across
the sea to woo her, with thirteen ships
flying beautiful flags of satin. At the
wedding, unfortunately, there was trouble
between the two kings; but after a certain
amount of friction the banquet was “carried
on with joyousness,” and the happy pair
journeyed towards Ireland with their thirteen
ships. In Ireland Branwen “passed her time
pleasantly, enjoying honour and friendship,”
which she owed to the fact&mdash;we are given to
understand&mdash;that she presented each of her
visitors with a clasp, or a ring, or a royal
jewel, “such as it was honourable to be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
departing with.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> By and by mischief was
made between Matholwch and his wife, and
she was sent to the kitchen to cook for the
Court, which seems a drastic way of treating
a Queen Consort. Then came Bendigeid Vran,
her brother, to avenge her, with the hosts
of seven score countries and four, and there
was war between the two islands because
of her. And only seven men of the Welsh
escaped, and in Ireland none were left alive
except five women. And Branwen went with
the seven men of Wales to Mona, and she
“looked towards Ireland and towards the
Island of the Mighty, to see if she could
descry them. ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘woe is me
that I was ever born; two islands have been
destroyed because of me!’ Then she uttered
a loud groan and there broke her heart.
And they made her a four-sided grave, and
buried her upon the banks of the Alaw.” And
her name still lives upon this rock of Harlech
in Branwen’s Tower.</p>

<p>Bendigeid Vran, the son of Llyr, was not
the last Welsh prince who held his Court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
here within sight of Snowdon. For Glyndwr
made his way in between those great towers
after a long siege, during which Henry’s
garrison, who were at last reduced to sixteen,
locked up their governor because they did
not trust his constancy. Glyndwr brought
his family here, and held a parliament, and
gathered a little Court round him; but after
another long siege he lost more than the
castle, for his son-in-law Mortimer was
killed, and his wife and grandchildren were
taken prisoners to London. But it was that
later siege by Edward IV.’s army that was
the most fierce of all. It was then that the
March of the Men of Harlech first stirred
the sea-breeze and the hearts of men; and
it was then that the blood of six thousand
men flowed here where we are standing
before the gates. Still later on Harlech held
very obstinately for Charles I.</p>

<p>At Harlech we look our last on Snowdon,
for the road, high above the sea, soon turns
a corner, then dips to the shore at Llanbedr.
At this pretty village those who are prepared
to face a road that finally becomes little more
than a track, and are, moreover, tolerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
good walkers, may leave the high-road and
drive up into a very wild and beautiful bit
of country to Cwm Bychan. I freely admit
that the enterprise is more suitable for
bicycles than for motors, and I further
confess that I have never undertaken it in
a car myself; but I should be extremely
happy to make the attempt on the first fine
day. For Llyn Cwm Bychan is a lovely
lake lying among moors and steep, rocky
hills; it has the wildness of a loch in
Galloway. And the only way out of this
hollow in the hills, except the track by
which we enter it, is a mighty staircase of
stone slabs set regularly in the hillside&mdash;a
staircase a mile in length, which has withstood
time and weather since the feet of the
Romans passed this way.</p>

<p>Even the best-advertised car could hardly
climb the Roman Steps; so we must rejoin
the coast road at Llanbedr and go on our
way to Barmouth. There was once a time
very long ago, it is said, when all the bay
that lies upon our right was a fertile plain,
the Plain of Gwaelod, with cities and
fortresses thick upon the ground, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
great and busy population, and a king
called Gwyddno Longshanks. And because
the land lay so low and the sea so close at
hand a mighty embankment of stone was
built along the shore, and all went well for
many a year. But there came a time when
the chief overseer of this great dyke was
Seithenyn ap Seithyn Saidi, and he, unfortunately,
has been known ever since as
one of the “three immortal drunkards of
the Isle of Britain.” It is easy to imagine
the result: the decay of the dyke, and the
terrible night when the waters swept all
before them and drowned the whole Cantref
of Gwaelod. The point of Mochras near
Llanbedr was at one extremity of the
drowned cantref; and still, when the tide
is low, you may sometimes see the long line
of the broken dyke. As late as the year
1824 there was a stone in existence which
had been found below the sea a hundred
yards beyond the shore, and bore an inscription
meaning, “Here lies the boatman to
King Gwynddo.”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> I do not know if the
stone still exists, but as it was used as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
footbridge it probably does not. At the
beginning of the nineteenth century this
seems, in Wales, to have been considered the
best way of using up old monuments. It was
certainly the quickest.</p>

<p>Eight miles from Llanbedr is Barmouth.
The town itself is becoming every year
more entirely a prey to the family group.
Every year there are more hotels, more
bathing-boxes, more wooden spades. But I
doubt if anywhere in England or Wales a
town is built in a more beautiful spot. You
cannot drive across the long bridge that
spans the estuary at its mouth, but you will
be a thousandfold repaid if you leave your
car and cross the bridge on foot, for the
best view&mdash;I think I am not too rash in
saying the best view in Wales&mdash;is from about
the middle of the bridge. The Mawddach
winds away between two ranges of mountains,
on whose grand slopes the brilliant
greens and purples, the rich browns and
far-away faint blues change every moment
under the varying sky. Cader Idris rises
on the right in gloomy dignity from the
soft drapery of foliage that is flung about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
his feet. And in the foreground, when the
tide is low&mdash;and that, I maintain, is the
loveliest time&mdash;the blue sea is riven with
the rosy gold of wet sands, dotted with
countless sea-gulls.</p>

<p>A great deal of this we can see as we
drive up the estuary on its northern bank
to Dolgelley, by an excellent road that clings
close under the hills. Every moment the
scene changes, and all the changes are good;
whether we look across at Cader’s grand
shoulder against the sky, or up the valley
at the winding water and the distant hills,
or overhead on our left at the mountain-sides
that rise so steeply from the very
road, or even when, the trees hemming us
in for a moment, we see only glimpses
through them of purple rock or shining
river. At Llanelltyd the Mawddach meets
the Wnion, and our way lies to the right
over the bridge. As we cross the bridge
the ruins of Cymmer Abbey lie upon our
left on the river-bank&mdash;a Cistercian abbey,
as we may easily guess, since we know the
pretty taste in scenery possessed by that
sagacious Order. If the truth were known,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
I fear we might find that their motive
in choosing, as they always did, the loneliest
and loveliest spots in the country,
was one of self-denial, for the mountainous
solitude that we love was in their day
regarded with little less than terror. This
particular abbey was founded in the last
years of the twelfth century, and it was
patronised by Llewelyn the Great. Behind
it, about two miles away, are the slopes
of Nannau, where Owen Glyndwr once
went for a walk with his cousin and came
back without him.</p>

<p>Owen, as I have already said, was a man
of swift and extremely complete vengeance,
and treachery made his gorge rise. His
cousin, Howel Sele, the lord of Nannau,
lived on that hill at the foot of Moel
Offrwm, and had little sympathy&mdash;so far
and so safe was he from the Marcher
Lords&mdash;with Owen’s overbearing ways.
Their relations had been strained, therefore;
but when Howel asked his kinsman
to visit him at Nannau Owen consented
without hesitation&mdash;yet not without a coat
of mail beneath his outer garment. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
they walked in the park with a few
retainers they saw a buck at some distance
among the trees, and Owen, anxious
to please, suggested that Howel should show
his well-known prowess with the bow.
Howel raised his bow, took aim, paused a
moment; then suddenly turned upon his
traitor’s heel and shot the arrow straight
at the heart of his kinsman. One can
picture Owen’s smile as the arrow rang
upon the coat of mail that he wore unseen.</p>

<p>Howel went home no more. What dreadful
fate befel him no one knows for certain;
for probably all his own retainers were
killed and Owen’s were too busy to talk.
But long afterwards a skeleton was found
in a hollow tree quite near the spot where
the famous bowman had drawn his bow
for the last time. The house of Nannau
was burnt to ashes.</p>

<p>Before we cross the bridge to Dolgelley
I should like to call attention to a very
beautiful drive over the hills between this
spot and Maentwrog. Beautiful as it is,
it must on no account be substituted for
the route by Harlech and the Barmouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Estuary, by those who are travelling in
this neighbourhood for the first time; but
those who know the estuary well, or those
who are staying at Dolgelley and wish for
a circular drive, could not do better than
go up the Vale of Ganllwyd and over the
hills to Trawsfynydd and Maentwrog, lunch
at the Tan-y-Bwlch hotel, and return by
Harlech.</p>

<p>For the first few miles the road rises
through lovely woods; the tempestuous
Mawddach shines behind the trees, and
beyond it, bounding the narrow valley,
are steep and craggy slopes. At Tyn-y-Groes
is a charming little hotel, much
frequented by fishermen, with a fine view
of the Mawddach and the peak of Moel
Offrwm; a delightful place to spend a
week in summer, since it is within a drive
of many of the loveliest parts of Wales,
and has itself an outlook of very striking
beauty.</p>

<p>Beyond Tyn-y-Groes the scenery grows
wilder and the hills more bare; the road
rises rather steeply and the surface is not
all that could be wished. Presently we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
pass a turning on the left that would
lead us, if we followed it, to the top of
that strange colossal flight of steps whose
lower end we saw at Cwm Bychan, the
way by which the Romans climbed this
mountain-side; and soon, as we reach the
summit of the hill, the many peaks of
the Snowdon range come into sight. After
this, as is only to be expected, the view
is continuously fine till we drop into Maentwrog
on a precipitous gradient, and find
ourselves in a valley famed for its beauty.</p>

<p>But we must return to Dolgelley.</p>

<p>“Dolgethle,” says Leland, who favoured
phonetic spelling, “is the best village in
this commote.” There is not much, if any,
of Leland’s Dolgelley left, I imagine; but
within the memory of this generation there
was still standing a battered little cottage,
built half of irregular stone-work and half
of timber and plaster, that Leland may
well have seen, though very likely it did
not interest him nearly as much as it
would interest us. It has been replaced
by an ironmonger’s shop, and we now
supply ourselves with petrol on the spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
where “Owen, by the Grace of God Prince
of Wales,” held his council, and drew up
the instrument that allied him formally with
the French. It was now some little time
since Henry IV.’s council had written to
him scornfully that the power of the rebels
was not so great as it was heretofore reported,
and that the people of Wales were
but of little reputation; for which reason it
seemed good to Henry, he said, “not to go
thither in person, but by one of our Lords
to do punishment on our said rebels.” Henry
had said that just three years ago, yet the
rebels were still unpunished. The chief rebel,
indeed, was now become “our illustrious
and most dread Lord, Owen, Prince of Wales,”
signing alliances with his royal hand and
seal, and receiving a gilded helmet as a
gift from the King of France.</p>

<p>At Dolgelley we turn eastwards and make
our way back to the English border. As
a matter of fact we have not actually reached
the limits of North Wales, which is divided
from South Wales by the river Dyfi, or
Dovey. But for our present purpose it
will be more convenient to consider a strip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
of the North&mdash;overlapping our present
route&mdash;together with a strip of the South,
as Mid-Wales, and to return to the border
by the laborious but beautiful pass that
rises between Dolgelley and Dinas Mawddy.</p>

<p>We have six miles of climbing before us,
close under the heights of Cader Idris,
through one of the wildest tracts of country
in wild Wales, where the road at last rises
steeply between rough stone walls across a
desolate moor, and a mountain stream dashes
below us on the right, and in all probability
a flock of little Welsh sheep makes excitedly
for the nearest gap. For the Welsh sheep,
unlike the sheep of England, has somewhere
in its round, woolly head a glimmer of
intelligence, and instead of rushing madly
past every turning and every gap, knows
where it wants to go and goes there with
all possible despatch.</p>

<p>At a point six miles above Dolgelley we
reach the summit of this precipitous pass,
the Bwlch Oerdrws, and the valley lies
below us like a gulf. It is a fine scene
and a very wild one&mdash;wild even when the
sun is shining, but still wilder when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
great bare hills are looming through driving
clouds of rain, and wildest and most beautiful
of all when the April snow is glistening
upon the April gorse.</p>

<p>The steepest part of the descent, the average
gradient of which is between 1 in 7 and
1 in 8, is about two miles long. For the
rest of the journey, through Dinas Mawddy
and Mallwyd, and up the long climb to
Cann Office, and so by Llanfair Caereinion
to Welshpool, there is nothing to pause for,
except tea at Cann Office. This mysterious
name, oddly enough, does not appear on
Bartholomew’s map where the place it
denotes is called Llangadfan. The little inn
there is very popular with fishermen, who
seem to have a wonderful knack of securing
homely comfort.</p>

<p>Between Cann Office and Welshpool the
scenery gradually becomes more English in
character, for Welshpool, though not actually
on the border, is very near it. “The grounde
about the bankes and valley of Severn there
is most pleasunt,” says Leland; and “most
pleasant,” I think, describes this country
perfectly. I cannot do better than end in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
his words. “And wille I passid this way
within a iii miles of Walsch Pole I saw a
veri notable hille beyound the valley on the
lift hond having iii toppes as iii heddes
rising owt of one body.... Communely
thei be caullid Brethin Hilles. Not far

<p>One may enter Mid-Wales by the Severn
Valley, or by Knighton and the Teme.
The probability is that one’s action in this
matter is entirely regulated by circumstances,
but if haply it were possible to be
guided simply by charm the road across the
wild hills would be the road to choose. For
wide moorlands, whatever the season, whatever
the weather, never fail to be attractive;
whereas the valley of the Upper
Severn is extremely variable in its appearance.
Indeed, I have seen it look almost
uninteresting: though in the spring, when
on every hill the fruit blossom is mingled
with the piercing green of the budding
larches, I know no place where the youth
of the year has a more engaging air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>In any case, we must pass through Newtown.
Despite its name, despite its modern
appearance, the newness of this town is only
comparative; for its prosperity waxed, I
believe, as that of Caersws waned; and
Caersws, a little higher up the valley, was
at its zenith in the days of the Romans.
We pass it by and by on our right: a mere
village now, of no particular attractions on
the surface, though no doubt a sufficiently
interesting past is buried beneath its soil,
for hypocausts have been found here and
tesselated pavement, and coins bearing the
magic name of Marcus Aurelius and other
names less honoured. Less authentic, but
more moving, are the associations of the
broad meadow on our left, the traditional
scene of Sabrina’s flight from&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i14">“the mad pursuit</div>
<div class="i0">Of her enragéd stepdame Guendolen,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and therefore connected for ever with
Milton’s exquisite lyric, “Sabrina fair.”
This is the “glassy, cool, translucent wave”
beneath which the goddess sits; this is “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
rushy-fringéd bank” from which&mdash;they say&mdash;she
still sometimes rises at twilight; and
here are the cowslips on which she sets
“her printless feet” so lightly that they
“bend not as she treads.”</p>

<p>Between Llandinam and Llanidloes the
scene begins to grow wilder; abrupt hills
bare, or patched with gorse, rise from the
roadside on our left; we are drawing nearer
to the slopes of Plynlimmon. At Llanidloes
there is a picturesque old market-place, and
the church, founded in the seventh century,
has some interesting and beautiful fragments
from the Abbey of Cwm Hir; a row
of fine Early English arches and some
quaint figures on the beams that support
the roof.</p>

<p>At Llanidloes we leave the banks of the
Severn, and, climbing all the way, pass
through a prettily wooded gorge into the
valley of another famous river&mdash;the river
that is more renowned for beauty than any
other in England&mdash;the Wye. But here at
Llangurig the Wye has few charms, for we
are at the foot of bleak Plynlimmon, and
the river flows through a somewhat dull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
country that is neither fertile nor wild.
Llangurig itself is a desolate, chilly little
place, but it has a nice inn; and I believe
the fishing is good. About eight miles beyond
it we leave the Wye, now a mere
mountain stream, at a point that is only four
miles from its source, and after this the
scenery grows more and more austere, as
we skirt the bare sides of Plynlimmon.</p>

<p>Upon those wind-swept slopes the red
dragon of Wales was once unfurled; for
here Owen Glyndwr, with only five hundred
men, was surprised and surrounded by
fifteen hundred of the Flemings of Pembrokeshire.
He cut his way through them,
and left two hundred of them behind
him, and left behind him, too, an unshakable
belief that he was a wizard
indeed.</p>

<p>These heights are not without grandeur.
At one point, indeed, there is a very striking
and unusual view, where the road is high
upon the hillside, and the river, very far
below, twists and curls away into the
distance through a narrow but extremely
level plain. The surface of this main road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
to Aberystwith is above reproach, but after
we turn off to the left on the road to
the Devil’s Bridge it is not so good and
there are some rather steep hills.</p>

<p>“If pleasant recollections,” says George
Borrow, “do not haunt you through life of
the noble falls, and the beautiful wooded
dingles to the west of the Bridge of the
Evil One, and awful and mysterious ones
of the monks’ boiling cauldron, the long,
savage, shadowy cleft, and the grey, crumbling,
spectral bridge, I say boldly that you
must be a very unpoetical person indeed.”</p>

<p>The falls, and the wooded dingles, and
the monks’ boiling cauldron are still beautiful
enough to rouse any poetical feelings
that we may possess; but the bridge, alas!
is neither crumbling, nor spectral, nor in
the least poetical. Three bridges now span
the rushing waters of the Mynach, built
closely one above the other. The lowest of
all, dapper and shining with the cement of
the restorer, is the original bridge built by
the monks of Strata Florida in the eleventh
century and ascribed to the Devil, not from
any uncomplimentary feeling towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
monks, but merely because the bridging of
the Mynach was no easy matter and demanded
a simple explanation. The bridge
above this is the one that Borrow calls
modern, though it was built in 1735, and
now looks older than the first; the topmost
and newest of all is quite a recent
achievement, and might well appropriate
the name of the original structure, since it
entirely destroys all the picturesqueness of
the scene. No doubt, however, its existence
is necessary, for this is the only way across
the gorge: and these beautiful wooded hills
and deep valleys, with the two tempestuous
streams, the Rheiddol and the Mynach, are
by no means dependent for their charm on
the famous bridge.</p>

<p>The road from this spot to Aberystwith is
of a most striking and uncommon character.
It is raised high on one side of the bare
hill, and overlooks a deep valley, through
which the Rheiddol twists and curves. The
great hills beyond the valley are richly
green in summer, but in the spring are
chiefly reddish brown, with streaks of the
vivid larch, and here and there a shining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
patch of gorse. A run of twelve miles,
mostly downhill, brings us to Aberystwith.</p>

<p>At the first glance, seen from a distance,
it is not unpicturesque. It lies at the end of
a valley, with the sea beyond it, and in the
heart of it the castle tower stands up conspicuously
to remind one that Aberystwith
was once something more interesting than a
popular watering-place. For once all the
resources of England were combined in an
attack upon this castle. Guns came from
Yorkshire, and timber from the Forest of
Dean; huge supplies of arms and various
murderous concoctions were sent from Hereford,
and a shipload of carpenters landed in
the bay to turn the timber into machines
of war. There was not a young spark in
the country, apparently, but thought it incumbent
on him as a man of fashion to
join Prince Hal outside the walls of Aberystwith.</p>

<p>Yet the end of all this effort and display
was merely comic. Glyndwr’s garrison at
last, half starving, agreed to yield the castle
upon a certain day unless Owen meanwhile
relieved it. The Prince, too hasty, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
sometimes was, went off to London joyfully
and received the thanks of Parliament for
having secured Aberystwith&mdash;at the very
moment, had he but known it, when Owen
and a relieving force were quietly entering
the besieged castle!</p>

<p>This was but one of many sieges suffered
by Aberystwith, which was always regarded
as a place of much importance; so
much so, indeed, that Strongbow’s castle on
this spot had been battered into uselessness
before the days of Edward I., who had to
build another. Prince Henry and Oliver
have left little enough of that. What
there is of it&mdash;some round towers and a
piece of the curtain-wall&mdash;is more tidy than
romantic. To tell the truth, Aberystwith is
not a romantic place.</p>

<p>It has been my happy fortune to read
some manuscript letters written by a lady
from Mid-Wales towards the end of the
eighteenth century. This is what she says
of Aberystwith&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have inquired about Aberystwith, where
the Sea is very rough, and no Apothecary
near, and most ignorant people in regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
to illness, which they are so happy to know
nothing of, as the Sea is their ownly
Physition.”</p>

<p>This might be useful as a house-agent’s advertisement,
if the next sentence were suppressed.</p>

<p>“I think the Sea fogs very unwholesom,
but dare not say so, as they are for ever
talking about the purity of their air.”</p>

<p>The sea is no longer the only physician
at Aberystwith; but the purity of the air
is still a topic of conversation.</p>

<p>One of its advantages is that it is only
fifteen miles from Ystradfflur or Strata
Florida; and though this does not lie upon
our route, so short a run is but a slight
tribute to pay to a place of such great
memories. The drive, moreover, will itself
repay us. The road follows the Ystwith
most of the way, and crosses it at Trawscoed,
where splendid beeches overhang the river
and masses of rhododendrons line the banks.
There is one formidable hill, with a gradient
of 1 in 8, from the top of which there is
a fine view of winding river and wooded
hills. Soon after leaving the Ystwith we
join the Teify near its source.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Abbey itself there is little to see,
but very much to remember. It was
founded in the twelfth century by some
Cistercian monks on land given by a
Norman; but its foundation is often ascribed
to that great prince of South Wales, the
Lord Rhys, who was one of its chief benefactors.
Once it was the grandest house of
worship in all Wales, the burial-place of
her southern princes, the depository of her
archives; but there is little left to show
its past greatness but the unique west doorway
and the remains of six side chapels&mdash;roofed
now with corrugated iron! Behind the
south transept is a wedge-shaped strip of
ground that was the monks’ cemetery, where,
under a stone carved plainly with a cross,
lies Cadell, the brother of the Lord Rhys. The
large cemetery that holds the dust of eleven
Welsh princes is between the Abbey and
the river. “The cœmiteri wherin the cunteri
about doth buri is veri large,” says Leland,
“and meanely waullid with stoone. In it
be xxxix great hue trees.” There were
originally forty of these yew-trees, and now
there are but two or three, so it is hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
likely that one of the survivors should be
the tree underneath which Dafydd ap
Gwilym, the greatest of Welsh poets, was
buried; the tree of which Gruffydd Gryg,
his rival, wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">“May lightnings never lay thee low</div>
<div class="i0">Nor archer cut from thee his bow.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mr. Baring-Gould tells us how these two
bards were constantly in a state of feud
and bitter rivalry, till an ingenious friend
put an end to their quarrels by simply
telling each of them that the other was
dead, and was to be buried at Strata Florida
on such-and-such a day&mdash;mentioning the
same day in both cases. Each of the poets,
in the glow of generosity consequent on the
death of a hated rival, composed a beautiful
ode in praise of his enemy, and proceeded
to the churchyard to read it beside the
grave. There, of course, they met; and
each, determined to read his ode at any
cost, forthwith read it to the hero of it,
and buried his enmity instead of his enemy.</p>

<p>It was somewhere within that “meanely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
waullid” cemetery that this quaint scene
took place; and it was somewhere within
these precincts that a thousand frightened
children crowded together long ago, waiting
to be carried away from their parents and
homes in Cardiganshire to the exile in
England to which Henry IV. had doomed
them. That is an ill-omened name in
Ystradfflur&mdash;the name of Henry Bolingbroke&mdash;for
in his fury at the rebellion of Glyndwr
he fell upon this sacred place and ruined
it, and drove out its monks, and stabled his
horses at its High Altar.</p>

<p>To reach Machynlleth, which is our object,
we must return to Aberystwith&mdash;but we may
do this by a slightly different road, diverging
at Trawscoed. The surface is better than
that of the other, and the road is wider,
but there is one bad hill, with a nominal
gradient of 1 in 7. As we approach
Aberystwith we see, beyond the river, a
little place called Llanbadarn Fawr. Here,
in very early times, long before the great
days of Ystradfflur, there was a famous
monastery, founded by St. Padarn, a contemporary
of St. David. Like St. David’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
own monastery, it was laid waste by the
Danes.</p>

<p class="caption">NEAR GLANDOVEY.</p></div>

<p>Passing through Aberystwith we climb
out of it on the further side by a long hill.
Except the wide view from this hill there
is nothing of special attraction in any way
till we have passed Tal-y-bont. Then
suddenly there comes into sight the headland
beyond the Dyfi (Dovey). Far away
on the left is the sea, and between us and
it lies a wide and absolutely level plain,
with Borth showing darkly on the shore.
Soon we pass Tre-Taliesin, named from the
great bard of Arthur’s day, whose grave is
said by some to lie on this hillside to the
right, and by others to be beside the waters
of Geirionydd. Beyond this village we climb
through lovely woods of birch and larch, and
then we run down, leaving the trees behind
us, into the beautiful estuary of the Dyfi.
A wide sea of gorse is at out feet; the river
winds through the shallows beyond; and,
bounding the valley and the view, rises the
mighty wall of North Wales.</p>

<p>This is on the left&mdash;a wide and splendid
landscape; and meanwhile on the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
are wild hills rising from the road, cleft
here and there by narrow wooded gorges
or tumbling mountain streams. At Ysgubor-y-coed
the water dashes down between
sharp rocks, and makes a lovely picture
with the great mill-wheel and mossy-tiled
building that stand beside it; and just
beyond Glan Dovey station we catch a
momentary glimpse of the steep sides of
the beautiful Llyfnant Valley. Thence four
level miles bring us to Machynlleth.</p>

<p>There is a charm about Machynlleth. Its
wide central street is planted with trees.
In most Welsh towns, History, though she
has lived in them so long, has rather an
uneasy air: tales of valour, or of treachery
on a large scale, blend rather incongruously
with prim grey houses and slate roofs.
But in Machynlleth we are quite prepared
to learn that these quaint and quiet streets&mdash;and
some of the houses, even&mdash;are bound
up very closely with the picturesque life
of the last of the Welsh princes: so closely
indeed, that Owen Glyndwr’s royal seal
figures in the arms of the town. In those
low, whitewashed cottages he held his first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
parliament; and in that little corner-house
in the next street he rested the uneasy
head that wore a crown for such a brief
and troublous time. It is the oldest house
in Wales, they say, but much renovation
and a new chimney have destroyed any
picturesqueness it ever had; and it is now
neither as venerable nor as interesting in
appearance as the Old Mayor’s House, a
timber-and-plaster building at one end of
the main street, with gables leaning in all
directions. Neither do the whitewashed
Houses of Parliament show any signs of
their distinguished past&mdash;yet here Glyndwr
accepted his crown and very nearly lost
his life. For among the members of this
his first parliament was one who was his
enemy, and the sworn man of the House
of Lancaster. Davy Gam, “the Crooked,”
a little red-haired, squinting man who,
whatever he was, was no coward, came to
this house with the intention of killing
Glyndwr, but being betrayed, was thrown
into prison for ten years, while his house
near Brecon was burnt to ashes. Owen,
with unusual forbearance, spared his life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
perhaps in acknowledgment of the man’s
courage in coming among his enemies
single-handed. He showed his courage more
honourably at Agincourt. “There are enough
to kill,” he said of the French just before
the battle, “enough to be taken prisoners,
and enough to run away.” He died on that
field, and was knighted by Henry V. as he
lay dying. “He lived like a wolf and died
like a lion,” it has been said of him.</p>

<p>Now, on leaving Machynlleth, supposing
it to be our intention to go on to Dolgelley
and so to Bala, we have a choice of roads.
All the ways are so beautiful, however,
that we can hardly go wrong; but those
who fix upon the shortest way, by Corris,
should know that they will find it well
worth while to run down the estuary to
Aberdovey and back again. For this estuary
of the Dyfi is second only to that of the
Mawddach in beauty.</p>

<p>Its best time, certainly, is in the summer,
for the hills are thickly wooded; but at
all seasons there is a lovely view at every
turn of the road. One of those that haunt
the memory is from the point where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
road to Aberdovey, after passing through
Pennal, comes again within sight of the
river. In the foreground is a wide expanse
of rich colouring, of red and brown, green
and gold and russet; beyond it shines a
thin line of silver; and beyond that again
rise the hills of South Wales&mdash;not so imposing
by any means as that massive bulwark
of mountains that we saw from the
other side and are now close under, but
yet very beautiful in colour and bold in
outline. As the estuary widens a succession
of headlands stretch out before us, one beyond
another, and round these the road
curves, sometimes very sharply. At the
extreme mouth of the estuary lies Aberdovey,
in the shelter of the hills.</p>

<p>The same eighteenth-century lady whom
I quoted before describes a visit to “Aberdove
Seaport,” as she calls it. “Down we
set at the window,” she says, “... to
see the Sea hempty it self in to a Beautifull
serpentine river, at the beginning of which
lay ten ships at harbour.” One cannot
marvel that any one should sit down at a
window to watch so strange a phenomenon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
as the sea emptying itself into a river.
Unfortunately this interesting sight cannot
now be promised to visitors at Aberdovey;
but the “beginning” of the river still owes
much of its picturesque effect to the little
quays that jut out into the stream, and the
ships of considerable size that lie “at
harbour.” The best hotel, and it is an
extremely nice one, is a short distance
beyond the little town, and is perched on the
hillside above the golf-links, facing the sea.</p>

<p>It was somewhere in this estuary, probably
on the shore of the Traeth Maelgwyn,
that a strange scene took place between
thirteen and fourteen hundred years ago.
Maelgwyn, that King of Gwynedd whose
name recurs so often in the history of
North Wales, that gigantic man of fitful
valour and still more fitful piety, determined
to unite all the strength of the west
under one ruler, the better to oppose the
conquering Saxons. It was agreed that all
the princes and knights who had any pretensions
should meet together in the estuary
of the Dyfi, the dividing-line between North
and South Wales; that they should there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
seat themselves on chairs upon the shore,
and he who contrived to keep his seat the
longest should be the king. Then Maelgwyn,
having settled these preliminaries, had a
wonderful chair made for himself of the
wings of birds, waxed. As the tide rose
the seats of the other princes were overturned,
but Maelgwyn’s chair floated on the
surface of the sea. So Maelgwyn became
chief of all the princes of the west.</p>

<p>From Aberdovey, as I said before, we
may, if we choose, drive straight on round
the coast by Towyn and Fairbourne, and up
the southern side of the Barmouth estuary
to Dolgelley. Or we may turn eastward at
Towyn, and reach Dolgelley by way of
Tal-y-llyn. Or, thirdly, we may return to
Machynlleth and drive thence to Dolgelley
by Corris.</p>

<p>No motorist should really rest satisfied
till he has driven on all these roads, so
beautiful are the three. Towyn, I believe,
has charms for many, but on the surface
it is singularly unattractive. It has a very
ancient church, however, built in the twelfth
century by Gruffyd ap Cynan, of whom it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
was said that he built so many that his
country “glittered with whitewashed churches
as the heavens are bright with stars.” Near
it are some extremely interesting old
memorial stones; but here, to all appearance,
the interest of Towyn begins and
ends. Beyond it there are some fine views
of the hills as the road turns inland; and
again when it turns to the coast and, high
on the side of the cliff, curves round into
the Barmouth estuary, the effect is really
fine. It must have been of this part of
the road that a traveller once wrote: “We
ascended a precipice, frightful beyond description,
on one side of us was the highest
ragget Rock I have seen, the stones to
appearance lose, and look as if just droping
on your heads, some of which have fell a
few years ago. The Precipice down to the
Mean (Main) Ocean not less than thirty
yards, and us travlers not a yard from
the side of it, where the waves dash and
tide rores, till it made me tremble.” Grand
as these “ragget” cliffs are, however, the
most beautiful part of this drive is in the
Barmouth estuary, under the shadow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Cader Idris. But to many travellers in
Wales this valley of the Mawddach is
thoroughly familiar, and to them I heartily
recommend the road by Corris.</p>

<p class="caption">THE RIVER DULAS.</p></div>

<p>From Aberdovey one drives back to a
point in the Dyfi Valley almost opposite to
Machynlleth. The river Dulas, near the
point where it joins the Dyfi, is spanned
by a fine old bridge, whose arches have
resounded to the tramp of Henry Tudor’s
followers, as he and they marched eastwards
to fight for the crown; and to the tramp
of Cromwell’s men as they marched westwards
to fight, if not for the crown, for
everything that goes with it. It is at this
point that we turn sharply to the left and
follow the course of the Dulas. This opening
of the valley of Corris is very lovely, for the
river, which has all the impetuosity of a
mountain stream, is overhung by splendid
trees, and through their stems in the spring
we may see the further bank, steep and
mossy, and thickly jewelled with primroses.
The whole of this narrow and wild valley,
indeed, is full of beauty. The road rises
gradually to a considerable height; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
beyond Upper Corris, where the landscape
is defaced, as so often in Wales, by enormous
banks of slate, it drops down by some very
steep gradients, amid fine mountain scenery,
to the level of Tal-y-llyn.</p>

<p>It is only the eastern extremity of the
lake that we see, and this we leave behind
us, turning at this point sharply to the
right into a defile of extreme barrenness.
This narrow gorge, with its towering sides
reft and lacerated by landslips, its huge
boulders poised as though about to fall,
its grey slopes softened only here and there
by patches of short grass, is the most
utterly, the most desolately savage spot I
have seen in Wales. As we leave it and
emerge into more open country, we realise
that those wild slopes were the foot of
Cader Idris, for looking back we see the
heavy grey shoulder of the mountain. Soon
we reach Cross Foxes, and thence run
down through beautiful woods on a delightful
gradient to Dolgelley, with the
purple hills of the Mawddach estuary showing
in a long line above and behind the
vivid green of the trees.</p>

<p class="caption">BALA LAKE.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>In Dolgelley, as we saw before, all the
historical interest is concentrated on a
lamp-shop. There is nothing to keep us
there, unless we wish for a meal, or perchance
a bed, at the “Golden Lion,” or unless
we mean to use the place, as many do, as
a centre for expeditions. But at present
our concern is to turn towards the English
frontier, and to reach it through Bala and
Llanrhaiadr.</p>

<p>For ten miles after we leave Dolgelley
the road ascends, persistently but never
steeply. The backward views of mountain,
wood, and stream are unfailingly lovely
on this road, as on all others that converge
at Dolgelley; and no less attractive in its
own way is the wilder scenery at the top
of this hill, which is practically a pass. From
the summit we descend to the shores of
Bala Lake, and after driving for three
miles close beside its waters we reach the
little town.</p>

<p>It is not an especially attractive place.
The neighbourhood of the lake is of course
pleasant, but the hotel&mdash;which, by the way,
like many Welsh inns, contains some lovely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
old furniture&mdash;looks out over the street.
The scenery of the lake is pretty rather
than grand.</p>

<p>Bala must have been more interesting, I
think, in Pennant’s day. It must certainly
have presented an appearance all its own;
for he assures us that the entire population&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;spent all
their time in knitting stockings. They
knitted in their doorways, they knitted as
they walked about the streets, and on fine
days they sat together on the tumulus
at the end of the town, and knitted there.
On Saturdays the fruit of all this industry
was sold, to the value of four or five hundred
pounds, in a special stocking-market. This
must have been a sight worth seeing.</p>

<p>We may still see the Tomen-y-Bala, the
tumulus where the knitters used to sit and
sun themselves, and where, very long ago,
a little castle stood. The mound has been
made very neat, with gravel paths and
rhododendrons; and by paying a small sum
we may climb to its modest summit and
give a thought to the Romans who made
the tumulus, and the Britons who made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
castle, and the past generations who made
stockings.</p>

<p>Leaving Bala, we may follow the Dee to
Corwen, and there join the great London
and Holyhead road; and this is by far the
simplest route we can choose.</p>

<p>The route we should certainly <i>not</i> choose
is the so-called road from Bala to Lake
Vyrnwy, the reservoir of Liverpool. The
scenery round this lake is very beautiful,
it is true, and an excellent hotel stands
high on the hillside above the water; and
since there is no railway among these wild
hills, this is one of the places that show the
uses of the motor-car most strikingly. But
Vyrnwy should be approached from Shropshire,
by way of Llanfyllin. The road that
connects it with Bala is a narrow, precipitous
pass, cut on the side of a slope
that is at some points almost a precipice,
unprotected by any kind of fence, sloping
downwards on the outer side, and crossed
at short intervals by natural water-channels.
It is a discouraging picture, and the reality
is, to put it mildly, uncomfortable.</p>

<p>As an alternative to the Corwen road we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
may cross the Holy Dee at the very spot
where the “wizard stream,” as Milton calls
it&mdash;that stream that had the gift of prophesying
good or evil fortune to the cause
of Wales&mdash;flows from the parent waters of
Llyn Tegid or Bala Lake, and following a
mountain road of many “dangerous” hills,
visit the waterfall at Llanrhaiadr before we
pass into Shropshire.</p>

<p>The fall is at a lonely spot about four
miles beyond the village of Llanrhaiadr,
which is itself a pretty place with a nice
inn. The road that leads to Pistyll-y-Rhaiadr
is little more than a lane, but one may drive
up almost to the very foot of the fall.
“Prodigious high,” says the letter-writer I
have so often quoted: “and seemingly the
hend of the world.” There is really some
excuse for this dramatic statement. An
abrupt mass of rock rises before us impassably.
On each side of it are pine-woods,
climbing the craggy slopes. There is an air
of finality about the place: it is “seemingly
the hend of the world.”</p>

<h2><a name="A_TOUR_IN_SOUTH_WALES" id="A_TOUR_IN_SOUTH_WALES">A TOUR IN SOUTH WALES</a></h2>

<p>For those whose affections are at all
equally divided between natural beauty
and historical interest the map of South
Wales presents a dilemma. The imperative
thing is to avoid the once beautiful hills
and valleys that are now scarred, and rent,
and blackened with coal-dust; and this may
be done by taking either the moorland road
above the mining country, or the level road
below it near the sea. Now I, who know
both these roads, assure you that in adopting
either of these courses you will miss much.
For if you choose the lower road, tempted
by its excellence, you will miss some of the
finest scenery in South Wales, which, though
not to be compared with the North, is yet
beautiful; and if you choose the upper one
you will miss the romance of Beaupré, and
the very ancient memories of Llantwit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Major, and you will, moreover, miss a good
many miles of as fine a road as ever made an
engine purr. There is only one way out of this
dilemma, namely, to follow a zigzag course,
from the sea to the hills, from the hills to the
sea, and so enjoy the best of both roads.</p>

<p>To avoid the mines we must aim very low;
at Cardiff or Caerphilly. And if we are
approaching the Border from Monmouth or
Hereford, or the Midlands, we shall probably,
just before we reach the spreading outskirts
of Newport, pass through a village with a
great name. A dull, sleepy-looking village
it is, standing in a commonplace landscape
beside a very dirty stream, a place entirely
without superficial attractions. But it is a
name to conjure with. Caerleon-upon-Usk,
the City of Legions! Once it “abounded
in wealth above all other cities, ... and
passing fair was the magnificence of the
kingly palaces thereof.” The gilded roofs of
the Romans glittered here beside the Usk,
and the great amphitheatre that may still
be traced once echoed to the shouts of the
second legion: towers and temples, baths
and aqueducts and splendid buildings stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
where now a few poor houses keep alive
the name of Caerleon. Round its shining
palaces grew up a world of legend. We
know all about the fine doings at Arthur’s
coronation here: how he and Guinevere were
crowned in different churches, and how the
music in both was “so transporting” that
the congregations ran to and fro between
one church and the other all day; and how
a banquet of great splendour followed, with
Caius, the server, dressed in ermine, and
Bedver, the butler, waiting with all kinds
of cups, and hosts of noblemen handing the
dishes; and how, after the feast, the soldiers
got up a sham fight to amuse the ladies,
who sat on the town walls and “darted
amorous glances in a sportive manner.” And
in the “Mabinogion” we are given a more
domestic picture of King Arthur at Caerleon-upon-Usk:
a picture of him in his
palace dozing upon a seat of green rushes
covered with flame-coloured satin, with a
red satin cushion under his elbow, while
Guinevere and her handmaidens sit at their
needlework by the window, and a group of
knights are drinking mead from a golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
goblet. And at Caerleon, too, it was that
Maxen Wledig, the truant Emperor of Rome,
built one of three great castles for Helen,
his wife. He had seen her first in a dream,
and sought her by land and sea, and having
found her he forgot his Empire and lived
in Britain seven years. So they made them
a new Emperor in Rome.</p>

<p>“And this one wrote a letter of threat
to Maxen. There was nought in the letter
but only this, ‘If thou comest, and if thou
ever comest to Rome.’ And even unto
Caerleon came this letter to Maxen, and
these tidings. Then sent he a letter to the
man who styled himself Emperor in Rome.
There was nought in that letter also but only
this, ‘If I come to Rome, and if I come.’”</p>

<p>So, through the Middle Ages, the memory
of the great days of Caerleon was preserved
in legend.</p>

<p>Long before we have finished dreaming of
King Arthur and his red satin cushion the
tram-lines of Newport force themselves upon
our attention. Newport was so called, I
believe, because it superseded Caerleon, the
old port, of which Leland says: “Very great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
shyppes might wel cum now to the town,
as they did in the Romaynes tyme, but
that Newport Bridge is a lette.”</p>

<p>Before leaving Newport any one who is
likely to be hungry soon will do well to
secure a meal, for though Cardiff is not
far away the ruins of Caerphilly take some
time to see, and the little town cannot be
depended upon for food. And we must on
no account miss seeing Caerphilly; for this
vast ruin covers more ground than any other
in this island, and, moreover, has the special
distinction of being a characteristically
Edwardian castle of a date earlier than
Edward’s. It was chiefly the work of Gilbert
de Clare, the Red Earl of Gloucester,
whose architect, unlike that great artist,
Henry de Elfreton, thought little of beauty
when he designed these mighty walls, but
altogether of strength. “Waules of a
wonderful thickness,” says Leland; and of
a wonderful thickness they are, and of a
wonderful tenacity too, seeing that one of
the great bastions that were mined with
gunpowder in the Civil War was only half
ruined, and the other half has been leaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
at a most surprising angle ever since. The
history of the ruins is not at all in proportion
to their size; and, indeed, it is possible
that their size and strength may have
acted as a deterrent to the makers of
history. There is a story that Edward II.
took refuge here with the Despensers; but
even these unyielding walls failed to give
any real sense of security to that poor spirit
and at the first word of his enemies’ approach
he hurried away, preferring to trust to disguise.
He chose the inappropriate <i>rôle</i> of
a farm labourer&mdash;this indolent, boudoir-King,
who had never done a day’s work in his
life&mdash;and he failed signally to please his
master, who was as anxious to be rid of
him as his subjects were. It was soon
after this that he was captured and led
away to the horrors of Berkeley Castle.</p>

<p>On the direct route from Caerphilly to
Cardiff there rises such a precipitous hill that
the longer way by Nantgarw is really the
best; and unless Cardiff has some special
attraction for us there is no need to thread
our way through its modern streets and its
maze of tram-lines. For the Cardiff of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Romans, and of the Welsh princes of Morganwg,
and of the Norman barons, is altogether
overpowered by the Cardiff of
commerce; and though there is a fragment
left of the castle that has sheltered so many
crowned heads at various times, the castle in
which poor blind Robert of Normandy was a
prisoner for twenty-eight years, yet even this
is modernised and closed to the public.</p>

<p>But in Llandaff, which is now practically a
suburb of Cardiff, there are still signs of age:
a picturesque green and restored cross, some
pretty old houses, and the cathedral of the
most ancient see in the island. For even
when St. Teilo of the sixth century laid the
foundation of the first cathedral the bishopric
of Llandaff had been in existence for more
than five hundred years. By the eleventh
century Teilo’s cathedral was past repair;
and when the “business of the Cross was
publicly proclaimed” here it was in a new
building that the Archbishop celebrated mass&mdash;the
same building, more or less, that stands
down there in that curious hollow to-day.
More or less: for the restorations of this
greatly chastened cathedral have been many,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
and it has narrowly escaped suffering even
more terrible things at the hands of its well-wishers.
Jasper Tudor’s beautiful and uncommon
west tower, for instance, was once
threatened by an eighteenth-century bishop,
a versatile soul who wrote a successful
“Treatise on the Modes.” He was evidently
more capable of dealing with the modes than
with ecclesiastical architecture, for we hear
that he was seized with a longing to remove
Jasper’s tower and replace it with a rustic
porch.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> For once the poverty of the see was
a fortunate circumstance, and saved the
tower. But no doubt that same poverty
injured the building greatly on many
occasions; for at one time the see was so
cruelly robbed by the Crown that its brave
and humorous bishop had himself presented
to Henry VIII. as the Bishop of Aff. “I was
the Bishop of Llandaff,” he explained, “but
lately the <i>land</i> has been removed.”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The tombs of Llandaff Cathedral are of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
great interest; and it is with real pleasure
that one sees the new, for once, not unworthy
to be beside the old. The recumbent figure
of marble on the grave of Dean Vaughan is
really beautiful.</p>

<p>As we climb the long hill a mile or two
beyond Llandaff, we see Cardiff stretched
out below us, a forest of masts and tall
chimneys&mdash;an impressive symbol in its way.
Then, when we reach the level ground, we
forget everything for a time but the sheer
delight of moving on a perfect road&mdash;forget
even the heights of Exmoor showing faintly
across the water on the left, and on the right
the wild hills of Glamorganshire rolling away
into the distance.</p>

<p>Now, at Cowbridge, it is necessary to come
to a decision. If it should be too much for
the resolution of an ardent motorist to leave
this road, he may pursue his way to Neath
without “lette,” as Leland would say; but
for all antiquarians, artists, and other lovers
of romance and beauty, the finger-post points
very resolutely to a detour by Beaupré,
Llantwit, St. Donat’s, and Ewenny.</p>

<p>About two miles south of Cowbridge is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Old Beaupré (Bewper). Do not climb the
stile and walk across the fields, but drive on
a hundred yards or so to the gate; for this
grass-grown, deserted avenue is the fitting
approach to the spellbound house of the
Bassetts, that strange mixture of splendour
and squalor, with its delicate carvings and
dainty Corinthian pillars and its air of utter
desolation. We know very well as we look
at it that fair faces once looked down through
those Tudor windows, and gay satins swept
between the classic columns of the doorway,
and the walls echoed to music and singing
and laughter, until the fatal day that an
enchantment was laid upon the beautiful
white doorway of the love-lorn Welshman
who learnt his art in Italy, and upon the
avenue that once led the Bassetts out to war
and home to love, and upon every stone of
the old castle, so that it became a farmhouse.
And now the fluted pillars and carved friezes
are green with moss and fringed with ferns,
and the walls echo to nothing but the
clucking of innumerable hens.</p>

<p>Beaupré is not greatly visited. There is,
indeed, nothing to see but that strange,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
incongruous doorway and the ghosts that
flutter round it; but it is one of those
eloquent, unforgettable places through which,
for a moment, one seems to be actually in
touch with the life that they have seen.</p>

<p>At Llantwit Major the interest is of a very
different kind. Here there is not very much
to attract the artist, but to the antiquary
and historian “the dwelling-place and home
of the Blessed Illtyd” must surely be of the
first importance. For it was here that the
Breton saint, St. Iltutus, or Illtyd, founded
a monastery and university that made a very
deep mark upon the life of the sixth century;
for its professors educated not only all the
princes of the west, but also every illustrious
Welshman&mdash;bishop, saint, or scholar&mdash;of the
day. It is not surprising that an institution
of its size and brilliancy&mdash;for its 2,400 students
filled four hundred houses&mdash;should have seized
the imagination of early writers, and given
rise to so much picturesque legend that it is
hard to know the truth. Some say that
St. David himself was taught by St. Illtyd,
and that Gildas the historian, called the
Wise, and Taliesin, the bard of the Radiant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
Brow, were also brought up here. Of Illtyd
himself the tale is told that he was originally
a soldier, but hearing the call, he forsook his
profession and his wife for the life of a
hermit; and when his poor wife came to him,
one day as he was working in the fields, he
silently turned away from her, and stood
so, with his back to her, till she left him in
despair. This is a pathetic foundation for
all the scholarship and saintliness of the
sixth century in Wales, and one can only
hope, for the sake of Illtyd’s conscience when
he was a comfortable professor, that it is
untrue. Of all the four hundred houses and
seven halls of his university not a stone is
now left; but in the church, which is itself
very full of interest, there are some wonderful
monuments, one of them being a
memorial raised to St. Illtyd by one of his
pupils, Samson, a saint himself. The head
of the cross is gone, but on the shaft the
beautiful Celtic designs are still clear and
the words still legible to those who can
read them&mdash;“Samson placed this cross for
his soul.”</p>

<p>Just beyond Llantwit and nearer to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Bristol Channel is St. Donat’s, which, as
Leland says, “stondith on a meane hille a
quarter of a mile from the Severn Se.” This
castle, partly Norman and partly Tudor, has
been inhabited ever since the Norman conquest
of Glamorgan; and so, as “the parkes
booth and the castell long to ... a gentilman
of very fair landes in that countery,” we
can see no more than a glimpse of towers
above the trees. But we pass close to the
churchyard, and there we may see the very
beautiful and uninjured Celtic cross.</p>

<p>From St. Donat’s we may rejoin the main
road at Bridgend; but in this country, where
good accommodation is not always to be
found, it is well to know that there is a
very nice modern hotel at Southerndown,
with the Channel and the Exmoor coast in
front of it and the trees and Castle of Dunraven
near at hand. The actual building of
Dunraven is new, but a castle has stood on
the same spot for many generations, through
many tragedies. In Henry VIII.’s reign the
lord of Dunraven, Boteler, or Butler, lost all
his children but one on the same day. He
saw them die, perhaps, for the windows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
his castle looked out across the waters that
drowned them. Only one girl was left, and
through her Dunraven passed to the Vaughans,
who do not always seem to have made
a good use of its position. For in Tenby
Church lies the dust of a certain Walter of
that house, who figures darkly in one of
those moral tales&mdash;one might almost call
them tracts&mdash;of which one occasionally hears
in actual life. In Walter’s day, which was
also the day of Queen Mary, these shores of
Dunraven twinkled with treacherous lights,
which lured unwary ships to the shore, causing
their complete destruction and the great
enrichment of the lord of the manor. At
last, after years of this villainy, he was
waiting one night for the fruits of his
labours, waiting while the doomed ship was
shaken to pieces and the bodies of her crew
were one by one washed ashore. The last
body that came was that of his own sailor-son.</p>

<p>Whether we approach Bridgend from
Llantwit or from Southerndown, we shall
see on our right the embattled tower of
Ewenny among the trees. The restored
conventual buildings of this very ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Benedictine Priory are now a private house,
but by leaving the high-road we may pass
the fortified gateway that once stood between
the monks and their enemies. There
is no finer example, I believe, of a monastery
that is also a castle, and no doubt it is
partly owing to the strength of its defences
that the Priory of Ewenny still stands in
its original Norman austerity, not as a
picturesque ruin, but as a parish church.
With the exception of one or two Tudor
windows, it is pure Norman throughout,
very simple, very dignified; and it is still
divided, according to ancient custom, into
two separate churches that were used respectively
by the monastery and the parish
at large. The founder, whose beautiful
tomb is wonderfully well preserved, was
Maurice de Londres, whose name we shall
meet again in a less amiable connection at
Kidwelly. A great deal has been done in
the way of restoring and preserving Ewenny
by its owners, the ancient lords of Coity,
whose great castle lies in ruins a few miles
away. The Norman marchers of their house,
it is said, set out to win the lands of Coity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
by force of arms, but seeing the fair daughter
of the Welshman who owned them, he was
himself won, and never a blow was struck,
for Coity became his by marriage. How
much of this story is true I do not know,
but it is certainly true that his descendants
have lived within a few miles of the spot
from that day to this.</p>

<p>At Bridgend we rejoin the road that we
left so reluctantly at Cowbridge, and soon,
on the right, we pass the hills of Margam,
at whose foot are the fragments of a famous
Cistercian abbey, more celebrated, we are
told, for its charitable deeds than any of
that Order in Wales; while on the left there
stretch between us and the sea the dreary
sands that long ago buried&mdash;“shokid and
devourid”&mdash;the castle and lands of Kenfig.
The hills, cleft here and there with deep
wooded valleys, are every moment drawing
nearer; a strip of glittering sea appears beyond
the sands, and beyond that again are
the Mumbles. For a little time the masts
of Aberavon rise picturesquely on the skyline,
but they are too soon replaced by the
chimneys of Briton Ferry.</p>

<p class="caption">NEATH ABBEY.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>It was here that the travellers of old days
used to ford the river Neath. It was a
dangerous ford, famous for its quicksands.
Wherefore a certain twelfth-century bishop
of St. David’s, being of a prudent temperament
and desirous to cross, selected one of
his minor clergy to ford the river before
him, a “chaplain of those parts,” who had
lately incurred the bishop’s displeasure, and
had been suspended. The chaplain meekly
consented; took the bishop’s best horse for
the purpose; crossed in safety, and forthwith
rode away. And it was only when
the bishop restored the cure that the chaplain
restored the horse.</p>

<p>This pleasant little story, recalled by the
name of the ugly smoky town of Briton
Ferry, will help us through the dismal
streets that lead to Neath.</p>

<p>Neath itself is not an attractive town.
Its abbey to Leland “semid the fairest
abbay in al Wales.” To-day it is perhaps
the most pathetic. During its last and most
splendid days a Welsh bard sang of it and
of the monks who lived in it; sang of its
towers and cloisters, and coloured windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
and princely shields; of its columns of blue
marble and of the painted archangels on
its roof. It was just at this time that it
seemed to Leland so fair, that is to say
just before Leland’s employer, Henry VIII.,
silenced the “peaceful songs of praise” of
its white monks for ever. Even now we
can guess at its past splendour, for though
the blue marble and the archangels are
gone, the crypt still has its vaulted roof,
and through the heavy ivy there are fragments
visible of the gleaming white stone
with which it was once faced. It stands,
unspeakably desolate, on the low, squalid
outskirts of the town, amid a waste of
scrap-iron and nettles and rubbish; but
when Edward II. came to beg for a night’s
lodging under its roof, when Neath was
little more than a village and a castle, and
there were no shunting, shrieking trains
between the abbey and the hills, this must
indeed have seemed a beautiful refuge for
a tired, hunted king.</p>

<p>For close behind the abbey the hills begin
to rise, and through them the river Neath
cleaves its way to the sea in a valley that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
will lead us, if we follow it, to extremely
desirable things. Ultimately the road will
lead us to Brecon, by no means to be
despised in itself, but it is rather for the
sake of the miles of moorland that lie
between that we must here strike up into
the hills in a way that may seem eccentric
till we know what they are like.</p>

<p>The Vale of Neath itself is famous for its
lovely scenery, its woods and mountains and
river. The road is practically level as far
as Glyn-Neath, where, if the day is young,
and the mood enterprising, we may, instead
of keeping to our rightful road, diverge
for a mile or so to Pont Neath Fechan.
Thence the active-minded and able-bodied
may visit a series of very pretty waterfalls
on the river Mellte. This entails a
considerable walk of a rough kind, but it
also gives one an excuse for exploring a
little more of this lovely moorland country:
for the best way to approach the falls is to
drive up for two miles into the hills and
so reach the river from above.</p>

<p>But probably the most usual course is,
at Glyn-Neath, to turn towards Hirwain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
It is after this point that the really distinctive
features of this run become apparent,
the features that make the road
essentially one for motorists; for no railway
crosses these hills, and if there be strong-limbed
bicyclists who do, they cannot often
be women, I think. For the road that
seems to the engine of a car to be merely
gently undulating, is really climbing steadily
upwards for miles. Gradually the scene
becomes wilder and wilder, more and more
desolate, till at last we are spinning over
a moor as wide as the eye can see, on a
road that winds visibly before us far away
into the distance. Range beyond range,
the hills completely encircle us: stern, bare
hills with rugged outlines, and never a
tree to soften them; and in the foreground
great sweeping curves covered with short
grass and here and there a glowing patch
of heather. Then, when the summit is
reached, and Cardiff waterworks are passed,
begins the descent of nine miles on a
perfect surface, close under the shoulder
of the Brecon Beacons. I think this gentle
descent is one of the most perfect runs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
from a motoring point of view, that I have
ever enjoyed; and if, as is likely, there is a
touch of evening softness over the great
hills, few people will regret having forsaken
their direct westward road for the sake
of this drive. Close under the Beacons
lies Brecon.</p>

<p>A prodigious amount of fighting has
raged round this peaceful-looking little
town. It was not without bloodshed that
Brychan the Irishman, in the fifth century,
made this country his own with complete
thoroughness, supplying it not only with
a new name but with a new population
(for he is said to have had forty-nine
children); and Brecon was one of the many
places that were attacked and overcome by
the army of Alfred’s warlike daughter
Ethelfleda; and truly there was no lack
of fighting in the days of the Normans, the
Neuf-Marché, and the de Braose. It was
Bernard de Neuf-Marché, or Newmarch,
who built the castle, once “very large,
strong, and wele mainteynid,” but now only
a remnant, a bit of battlemented wall and
a tower, which passed through many stormy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
experiences before it came to the strangest
end to which, surely, a castle was ever
brought. For it was the inhabitants of
Brecon themselves who, feeling that they
had figured sufficiently in the annals
of their country, demolished their own
castle. It was during the Civil War, and
a siege seemed imminent. The simplest
way of avoiding this was to remove the
castle.</p>

<p>Brecon might well be tired of fighting.
Newmarch had fortified it well, with walls
and gates and the “keepe of the castel
very large and faire,” but it required all
its defences and more, for a border castle
was never safe. From the family of Newmarch
it passed to that of de Braose, and
they lost it again, not by the sword but by
the seditious spirit and shrewd tongue of a
woman. Matilda de St. Valerie, the wife of
William de Braose, “uttered reproachful
language against King John,” which though
perfectly just, was rash. She lost not only
her castle, but her husband and finally her
life, for Brecon became Crown property;
de Braose, after slaughtering the King’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
garrison, fled to Ireland; and Matilda was
starved to death in prison.</p>

<p class="caption">GATEWAY KIDWELLY CASTLE.</p></div>

<p>If we spend a night in Brecon we may
sit in the pretty garden of the hotel
under the shadow of the last remaining
wall of Newmarch’s castle. Opposite us,
filling almost the whole landscape, are the
solemn Beacons; just below us is the Usk
and its picturesque bridge.</p>

<p>We must cross that bridge to reach Carmarthen;
and following the course of the
Usk, pass through Trecastle, where the
scenery becomes strikingly beautiful as
the road cleaves a narrow gorge and then
runs gently down for miles between wooded
hills. At Llandovery we enter the valley of
the Towy.</p>

<p>There is nothing to detain us at Llandovery;
but as the gay flowers of the
Castle Inn catch our eye in passing we
may remember that George Borrow once
spent a night there; and the remains of
the castle hard by may perhaps call to
mind the great chieftain Griffith ap Nicholas,
who was lord of Dynevor and Kilgerran as
well as of Llandovery and many another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
castle. He was also a Justice of the Peace,
and a harbourer of thieves; a <i>protégé</i> of
the House of Lancaster who yet died in
fighting for the house of York at Mortimer’s
Cross: not a very conventional
person, in short.</p>

<p>We leave the fragments of his castle on
our left, and, on a practically level road,
follow the slow-flowing Towy through Llangadoch
to Llandeilo. This pretty little place,
where there is a really nice inn, was once
dignified with the name of Llandeilo Vawr,
or the Great; probably because of its close
proximity to the great castle of Dynevor.
If we pause for a moment on the bridge
that here crosses the Towy we shall see
reflected in the river a thickly wooded bluff.
Among these trees are the ruins of Dynevor,
perhaps the most important stronghold of
the princes of South Wales. It was in the
ninth century that Roderic the Great built
the first castle here, and from that day forward
till Roderic’s fortress had for many
years been replaced by a Norman one,
Dynevor passed from hand to hand, from
Welsh to English and from English to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Welsh, and from one turbulent chieftain to
another. It seems to have been regarded
more or less as the key to South Wales;
for on one occasion Henry II. sent a special
spy to inquire into the strength of Dynevor
and the general character of the country.
This artless knight asked his way of a Welsh
dean, and was, as he might have expected,
led by a route so wild, so rough, and so
extremely circuitous that the castle seemed
to be practically inaccessible. By way of
heightening the effect this humorous divine
paused at intervals to satisfy his hunger
with handfuls of grass. It was the custom
in that poor country, he said. The knight
returned to Henry with the report that the
country round Dynevor was “uninhabitable,
vile, and inaccessible, only affording food to
a beastly nation, living like brutes.”</p>

<p>Within a few miles of Dynevor there is
another castle that looks as if it might well
have been inaccessible&mdash;Cerrig Cennen. It
is worth while to drive a few miles out of
our way to see this circlet of towers on its
pale grey crag, dominating the whole landscape
of rounded hills. It is best to approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
it by Derwydd Station, partly because the
more direct route leads over a long and
precipitous hill, and partly because from
this side one’s first view of the old fortress
is more striking. I think there is little to
be gained by trying to drive close to the
actual ruins: the impressive effect is in the
distant outline of this strange and sudden
crag, on which, it is said, a Knight of
the Round Table built his fortress before
the Norman of later days made it his
stronghold.</p>

<p>From Llandeilo to Carmarthen we have
a choice of roads. The upper one is perhaps
slightly the faster of the two, but
from the lower there is a better view of
Dynevor, and Dryslwyn Castle, and Abergwili,
the palace of the bishops of St.
David’s. In Carmarthen itself there are
few relics left of a history that begins in
the days of the Romans and has been
stormy to a most unusual degree; so
stormy, indeed, that one marvels the place
exists at all. The wicked Vortigern, King
of Britain in the fifth century, is said to
have built a castle here, to defend himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
against a too persistent saint who was trying,
quite in vain, to turn him from the
many errors of his ways. He had first
taken refuge at Rhayader, but, says Nennius
the historian, “St. Germanus followed him
with all the British clergy, and upon a rock
prayed for his sins during 40 days and
40 nights.” So the worried King fled
here to Carmarthen and built a castle in
which to hide. But, says the story, “the
saint as usual followed him there and with
his clergy fasted and prayed ... and on the
third night a fire fell suddenly from heaven
and totally burnt the castle.” How many
times since then Carmarthen has been burnt
to the ground and besieged and plundered
I do not know, but one or other of these
incidents is casually recorded on nearly every
page of the History of Wales. But Carmarthen,
like hope, “springs eternal.” Among
the many who burnt it is Owen Glyndwr,
who at the very time that the foolish legend
describes him as sitting in a tree watching
the Battle of Shrewsbury was really occupied,
not only in destroying this town, but also, as
though influenced by the reputed birthplace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
of Merlin, in having his fortune told by a
soothsayer brought from Gower for the purpose.
But though this brave fortune-teller
prophesied evil things they were not fulfilled.
Owen had still many successes before him,
and his dealings with this ill-fated town of
Carmarthen made a great sensation. There is
an agitated letter still existing which the Archdeacon
of Hereford, the “lowly creature,” as he
signed himself, of Henry IV., wrote in “haste,
great haste,” to implore that King for help.
“And note,” he adds in a postscript, “on
Friday last Kemerdyn town is taken and
burnt, and the castle yielded ... and slain
of the town of Kemerdyn more than L persons.
Written in right haste on Sunday;
and I cry your mercy and put me in your
high grace that I write so shortly; for by
my troth that I owe to you, it is needful.”
The exciting effect of Owen’s presence, we
see, was of somewhat wide radius. Yet even
Owen could not suppress Carmarthen for
more than a short time. Leland tells us of
two “reparations done on the castel,” and
in his day, he says, it was “veri fair and
doble waullid.” Even now there is some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
it left, but unless we exceed the speed-limit
and refuse to pay the fine we shall probably
not see it, as it has been made into a
prison.</p>

<p>But even the modern streets that have
risen from so many ashes are not without
their own memories of the great. They
were once lined with shouting, excited
crowds, gathered from all the country
round to see Nelson drive through the
town: and through them passed the strange
funeral procession of Richard Steele, who
was carried by night, attended by twenty-five
torch-bearers, to his grave in St. Peter’s
Church. Above it a modern brass has been
placed of late years, but for long the grave
was, at his own dying request, left nameless.
“I shall be remembered by posterity,” he
said. There are other monuments worth
seeing in St. Peter’s Church: the tomb of
Sir Rhys ap Thomas, to whose efforts
Henry VII. owed much in his quest for
the crown; and a mural tablet of the seventeenth
century, to “virtuous Anne, the lady
Vaughan,” who was, we learn, “the choice
elixir of mortalitie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>From Carmarthen we must certainly not
neglect to visit Kidweli, ten miles away
near the sea, for there we shall find much
of that visible romance that has, by storm
and stress, been battered out of the county
town. Kidweli once had walls, and three
gates, and a priory of Black Monks, as well
as the castle that still stands above the river
Gwendraeth in all its imposing simplicity.
The round towers and the curtain-wall and
the great gateway have a very distinctly
Edwardian character, but Caradoc of Llancarvan
says there was a castle built here
quite at the end of the twelfth century by
Rhys ap Griffith, that great prince of South
Wales who is known in Welsh history as
The Lord Rhys; and even in those destructive
days a hundred years was a short time
for a castle to last. Probably Rhys built it
and Edward repaired it, giving it the special
character of his own work, but not entirely
wiping out the work of Rhys. In this way
we may account for the name of Gwenllian’s
Tower, for Rhys had a much-loved daughter
Gwenllian, “a woman of such incomparable
beauty, and exceeding in all feminine quali<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>fications,
that she was accounted the fairest
and best accomplished lady in all the country.”
She had fine traditions behind her, but they
were not so much “feminine” as warlike;
for her father Rhys was “the protection of
his country, the splendour of arms, the arm
of power,” and her great uncle was the valiant
Owen Gwynedd, and her grandmother was
that gallant lady after whom she was doubtless
named, Gwenllian the wife of Griffith.
It was quite near Kidweli that this other
Gwenllian died. In her husband’s absence
she led his men to battle against the Norman
invader, Maurice de Londres, whose grave
we saw in his priory-church of Ewenny.
Her forces were defeated, and she herself, by
order of de Londres, was beheaded there
and then. Her brother Owen Gwynedd, however,
was still alive, and he saw to it that the
reckoning was heavy.</p>

<p>The road from Carmarthen to Tenby lies
at first through rather dull country, but
after a time passes between extremely
pretty wooded hills. Presently we catch
sight of the sea shining at the end of a
deep valley, and after this a delightful run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
on a downward gradient carries us within
sight of Tenby, the most charming of
watering-places. Now, it is not altogether
an artificial classification if we divide the
civilised world into two parties: those who
delight in watering-places and those who
flee from them. For this taste or distaste
is really, more or less, an indication of
temperament, and at the end of half an
hour one could usually guess correctly in
which of the two classes to place a new
acquaintance. But I really defy any one to
dislike Tenby. There is something endearing
about it. From the roadside the cliffs
drop steeply to the sands below&mdash;very
yellow sands sweeping in long curves to the
edge of a brilliantly green sea, while beyond
them the long headlands stretch one behind
the other, mere blurs of purple or misty
blue. On the right the remnant of the
castle stands upon a rock, and below it
there juts into the sea a picturesque little
pier, entirely for use, and innocent of
pavilion or bandstand. Here the innumerable
trawlers take shelter, till in the early
morning they unfurl their crimson or brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
sails, and one by one glide out into the
bay&mdash;a brave sight, and one that calls to
mind the early name of this place, Dynbych-y-Pysgod,
the Little Town of Fish.</p>

<p class="caption">MANORBIER CASTLE, NEAR TENBY.</p></div>

<p>There is something almost incongruous in
the thought of the many sieges that this
quiet, sunny town has suffered. From very
early days it played an active part in the
history of this strange English corner of
Wales, and if its walls and gateways are
still standing to add to its beauty, this is
not for want of use, but because their uses
were so constant that they were kept in
good order. Of the castle, indeed, little
enough remains: a ruined tower, an archway,
and a fragment of wall are all that is
left on the rock that juts out so picturesquely
into the green sea.</p>

<p>But if the shrewd blows of several centuries
have left us little of Tenby Castle, it
is far otherwise with the splendid walls and
towers of Manorbier, which stand close above
the sea a few miles further along the same
coast. To see Manorbier at its best one
should approach it from the road called the
Ridgeway, and this route, too, has the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
advantage of commanding, here and there,
some very lovely views of the coast, of
Lydstep and Caldey Island. It is well to
know that on Sunday no strangers are
admitted within the gate of Manorbier.</p>

<p>It stands, as Leland says, betwixt two
“hillettes, between the wich the Severn Se
gulfith in”&mdash;a fine setting for its battlemented
walls and towers, the “turrets and
bulwarks” of which Giraldus proudly speaks.
That most delightful chronicler declares this
to be the pleasantest spot in Wales, and
then half apologises for his enthusiasm over
this “his native soil, his genial territory.”
We may forgive him for his love of the
place, even if we think he goes a little too
far, for this Gerald de Berri the Norman,
who oddly enough has been known to all
who have come after him as Giraldus the
Welshman, was born here at Manorbier;
and down there on the shore are the sands
where he played as a child, building, we are
told, not castles, but always churches and
abbeys.</p>

<p>Strange enough this belligerent-looking
building seems to have no history. It has,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
apparently, led an entirely domestic life.
We hear of mills and ponds, of parks and
dovecots in connection with it, but of siege
and bloodshed not a word. The great, grim
walls and bastions, however, must have
added greatly to the peace and comfort of
the Norman barons who lived behind them,
and they certainly add very much to our
pleasure.</p>

<p>Climbing again to the Ridgeway we turn
to the left, with a view to seeing Lamphey,
Pembroke, and the Stack Rocks before,
following in the footsteps of many a
pilgrim, we visit the shrine of St. David.</p>

<p>Lamphey Palace was for several centuries
one of the dwellings of the Bishop of St.
David’s; and a good deal of it was built by
Bishop Gower, whose “mason’s mark,” so to
speak, is the arcaded parapet so conspicuous
here and at his cathedral city. Bishop
Gower seems to have been the benefactor
of this see, as Bishop Barlow was its evil
genius. It was owing to the latter that
Lamphey passed to the Crown, and thence
to the house of Devereux; and so it came
to pass that in this sequestered corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Robert, Earl of Essex, passed the early years
of a life that was destined to be anything
but sheltered, and played his childish games
with no thought of a capricious queen or
of Tower Hill. And with him, no doubt,
played his sister Penelope, whom the pen of
Sir Philip Sidney has made more familiar to
us as “Stella.”</p>

<p>From Lamphey two miles of level road
will take us to Pembroke, and to the castle
that is perhaps the most impressive in all
this land of relics, where the castles are so
strangely thick upon the ground. The great
walls rise upon a rock whose base is lapped
by the waters of Milford Haven; in the
centre stands the mighty double keep, and
round it is a ring of bastions; on the town
side is the entrance-gate, flanked by massive
towers. There is something peculiarly imposing
about this gateway, whose implacable
strength seems all the more uncompromising
from its being unsoftened by ivy and very
little discoloured by time, though its fine
effect is, of course, cruelly marred by the
lawn-tennis nets that seem so often to be
regarded as pleasing and appropriate addi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>tions
to mediæval castles. Pembroke, unlike
Manorbier, is full of history; there has been
no lack of sieges here. Even before the
building of this castle there were stirring
doings round this rock: fierce attacks and
wily stratagems, not unmixed, some say,
with romance. There was a “slender fortress”
here, built by Arnulph de Montgomery
of stakes and turf&mdash;a poor defence
one would have thought, but apparently
sufficient to bear a good deal under the
guardianship of that “worthy and discreet”
constable, Gerald de Windsor, grandfather
of our Giraldus. He showed his discretion
on one occasion, when the stakes and turf
were besieged by the Welsh, and his garrison
was extremely short of food, by cutting
up the last few beasts that remained to
them, and throwing the pieces to the enemy.
In our day this would be described, not as
discretion, but as “bluff,” and it was as
successful as that quality so often is. It is
said by some that it was this same Gerald
who built the existing castle, but there
seems to be a good deal of uncertainty on
the subject; and even more uncertainty as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
which castle it was from which Gerald’s
wife Nest, who was less discreet, apparently,
than her husband, was carried off by a
Welsh prince, not without encouragement
from the lady. But when one hears that
the discreet Gerald escaped on this occasion
by creeping down a drain-pipe, one feels
that there was some excuse after all for
Nest. But these are mere traditions. What
is very certain is that one of the stern
entrance-towers was the birthplace of
Henry VII., who lived here with his mother
through the early years of his life, and after
his exile in Brittany landed only a few miles
away at Dale, where he won the Welsh at
once to his cause by unfurling the Red
Dragon of Uther. When Leland was here
he was shown the room in which Henry
was born, and in it “a chymmeney new
made with the armes and badges of King
Henri the VII.”; but this fireplace must
have vanished long ago, for even the local
guide-books do not profess to know the
room of Henry’s birth.</p>

<p>There was a memorable siege of Pembroke
in the Civil War&mdash;memorable not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
because of its importance, but because the
leaders of the Royalist garrison were renegade
Roundheads. Cromwell’s guns were
lying useless in the sand, for the ship that
carried them had run aground; but undismayed
he determined to starve the garrison
out. “Here is a very desperate enemy,”
he wrote to Fairfax, “who being put out of
all hope of mercy, are resolved to endure
to the uttermost extremity, being very
many of them gentlemen of quality and
thoroughly resolved.” They yielded at last,
and “Drunken Colonel Payer,” as Carlyle
calls the renegade, “full of brandy and
Presbyterian texts of Scripture,” being
indeed out of all hope of mercy, was shot
at Covent Garden. Beyond hope of mercy,
too, was the traitor who, by betraying the
source of the castle’s water-supply to Cromwell,
was the cause of the surrender.
Cromwell, with characteristic promptitude,
cut the drain-pipes and hanged his informant
on the spot; and not many years ago
some workmen found the broken pipes, and
close beside them some human bones.</p>

<p>About eight miles beyond Pembroke are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the Stack Rocks. The road is hilly and the
gates across it are exasperatingly numerous;
but these are but small discomforts, and
the reward is very great. It is almost suddenly
that one finds oneself on the very
edge of the stupendous cliffs that form the
southern coast of Pembrokeshire&mdash;an edge
that is almost mathematically a right angle,
so sheer is the drop, so level is the plateau
above. This stern, impregnable coast has the
impressiveness that extreme simplicity on a
large scale always has: it has the directness
of Early Norman architecture. There is not
an unnecessary line, so to speak, not the
least attempt at ornament; and the effect
is to take away one’s breath. A few yards
from the cliff are the great pillars known as
the Stack Rocks, obviously separated from
the mainland by the patient efforts of the
sea and air&mdash;examples of the survival of the
fittest. Their tall, gaunt outlines, and the
sea-gulls that circle round them, add much
to this strange scene; but our real reward
for opening all those gates lies, not in the
actual Stack Rocks themselves, but in the
long curves of the coast-line, the massive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
cliffs, the green, transparent sea that swirls
about their base.</p>

<p>It is necessary to pass through Pembroke
on the return journey, but we must leave it
by the Carmarthen road, since to reach
Haverfordwest we have to avoid all the
long ramifications of Milford Haven. Soon
we turn sharply to the left and enter the
tiny village of Carew, where, close beside
the roadway, stands one of the finest Celtic
crosses in Wales, richly carved with one of
those interlaced designs that the Welsh in
very early days copied from the Irish. And
not very far away is another of those
splendid castles that were, to a Norman
baron in Wales, among the bare necessities
of life&mdash;the half Norman, half Tudor castle
of Carew, or Caer-wy (the Fort on the
Water), whence the pronunciation <i>Carey</i>.
The east front, the entrance-gate and bastions
are, I believe, the work of Gerard de
Windsor, constable of Pembroke, and are
plainly Edwardian in character; but the
north front, with its famous mullioned
windows, was added by Sir Rhys ap Thomas,
the energetic supporter of Henry VII., whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
tomb we saw at Carmarthen; while the
eastern side, with the great banqueting-hall
and the lovely arch that leads to it, was
contributed by Sir John Perrot, of Elizabethan
days. This Sir John Perrot was one
of the worst of the Irish Lords Deputy, but
it was not on this account, very certainly,
that he was suddenly called away from his
building operations at Carew and bestowed
in the Tower of London. The builders,
delivered from his vigilant eye, did their
work so perfunctorily that it is now in a
more dilapidated condition than the sturdy
defences of the Norman part of the castle.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
But perhaps the old splendour of Carew is
represented and recalled best of all by the
beautiful rooms on the northern side, whose
thresholds have been trodden by so many
mailed feet, so many dainty silken shoes;
for the hospitalities of Carew, at all events
in the days of Sir Rhys ap Thomas, were
carried out on a large scale. Henry of
Richmond, not yet Henry of England, was
entertained here on his way to Bosworth,
and mounted the stairs to the room that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
displays his arms upon a shield, only a
little time before he mounted the steps of
the throne. This last event was celebrated
here in a magnificent pageant, a medley
of feasts and tournaments and sermons, at
which a thousand guests filled these weed-grown
rooms with all the glitter and colour
of an age that loved fine clothes. Sir Rhys
himself figured on the occasion in “a fine
gilt armour,” and was attended by “two
hundred tall men in blewe coats.” The
banqueting-hall on the east side was not
then in existence, but there was nevertheless
“a goodlie spaciouse roome richlie
hanged with clothe of arras and tapestrie”
in which “the bettermost sort” were entertained,
a cross table being laid at one end
for the King who was so many miles away.
And yet, in spite of these rash distinctions
among the guests, we are assured by the
chronicler that “one thing is noteworthy,
that for the space of five dayes among a
thousand people there was not one quarrell,
crosse word, or unkind looke that happened
betweene them.” It seems almost unnecessary
that the bishop, before they parted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
should have “bestowed a sermon upon
them.”</p>

<p>Fifteen miles of a hilly road lie between
Carew and Haverfordwest, a town that was
important enough in Edward IV.’s day to
be made a separate county. It was the
chief town and stronghold of the Flemish
colony, and the dominating position of the
castle bears witness to its former usefulness;
while its present mission as a gaol
does nothing to detract from its grim
appearance.</p>

<p>It was outside the embattled walls of
Haverfordwest that Glyndwr first met his
French allies, who had landed in Milford
Haven from their hundred and forty ships.
There were four or five thousand of them,
very gay in their apparel, very rich in their
accoutrements, and here before the hill of
Haverfordwest they must have been an
encouraging sight for a man whose luck
was beginning to turn. But this stern castle
withstood them, none the less, and though
they burnt the town, they were obliged to
retire. In the Civil War the Royalist garrison
adopted a simple plan for saving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
themselves from the discomforts of a siege.
Hearing that the enemy was approaching,
it seemed to them that the best way to
avoid unpleasantness would be to leave the
place vacant, which they did with all possible
despatch.</p>

<p>There are a good many things that we may
think of in this town: those “people brave
and robust,” as Giraldus calls the Flemings
whom Henry I. established here; poor
Richard II., who gave them their charter;
Edward IV., who gave them a high sheriff;
the sieges of centuries; the gay French
army; but I, when I climb the steep streets
of Haverfordwest, long most of all to
know the spot on which the Crusades were
preached to “a people well versed in commerce
and woollen manufactories.” “It
appeared wonderful and miraculous,” says
the historian, with no consciousness that he
is saying anything humorous, “that although
the archdeacon addressed them both in the
Latin and French tongues, those persons
who understood neither of those languages
were equally affected, and flocked in great
numbers to the cross.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>In the days when people journeyed to St.
David’s for the good of their souls it was considered
that two pilgrimages to that shrine
secured as many spiritual advantages as one
pilgrimage to Rome. It seems hard that
those who now approach St. David’s by
train should not derive some solid benefit of
this kind, for the penance must really be
very great, since Haverfordwest is the
nearest station, and the road between the
two places is known as “sixteen miles and
seventeen hills.” One passes these sad
pilgrims, packed very closely in hired
wagonettes behind still sadder horses, and
one hopes that good may accrue to their
souls, since surely this must be very bad for
their bodies. Even bicyclists, our brethren
of the road, must find these seventeen hills
no easy task. The pilgrimage to St. David’s
is pre-eminently one for motorists.</p>

<p>The surface, on the whole, is good, and
near the coast the scenery is fine. As the
sea comes into sight on our left the rather
dull, flat landscape to the right is enlivened
by the curiously sudden crag on which stand
the remains of Roche Castle, the birthplace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
of Lucy Walters, the Duke of Monmouth’s
mother. After a time the road dips suddenly
to the shore at Newgale, where the
sands stretch for two miles between low
headlands, and where long ago the sea once
receded and showed the blackened stumps
of a huge submerged forest. Between this
and St. David’s are “divers other little
creekittes,” says Leland, who has a passion
for diminutives of an original kind; and of
them all none is so charming as little Solva
where the narrow creek runs up far into
the land, and a picturesque village climbs
the hill, and the “fischerbotes” take refuge
now as they did in the sixteenth century,
and probably long before it.</p>

<p>A few minutes later appear the outskirts
of the strangely squalid village that is the
cathedral city of St. David’s. The straggling,
ugly street gives little promise of reward
for our pilgrimage. Then suddenly we are
at the edge of a hill, and we look down into
the little dell that holds, perhaps, as much
beauty and history and legend as any spot
of its size in our country: the cathedral
itself, very plain and built of a strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
purple stone; close beside it the ruins of
St. Mary’s College, founded by John of
Gaunt and his wife; and beyond it the far
greater ruins of Bishop Gower’s very beautiful
palace, with its great rose-window and
the arcaded parapet that characterises the
bishop’s buildings. And to the seeing eye
this little hollow contains far more than
these mere stones: it is filled with countless
memories of saints, and those who were
anything but saints; it is crossed by a long
procession of pilgrims; William I., who came
to worship before St. David’s shrine and in
some sort apologise, as it were, for conquering
the country&mdash;an apology that was
rather premature; Edward I. and his faithful
Eleanor, on the same errand, with more
reason; William Rufus, with little interest
in saints or shrines; Henry II., “habited like
a pilgrim, and leaning on a staff,” and met
at the gate by a long and solemn procession.
Of all these, Edward was the only one
who worshipped in this very building, for it
is the fourth that has stood on this spot
and was raised just after Henry II.’s visit.
Much restoration has given it the look of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
a new building, as seen from the outside.
Perhaps this is why, as one passes through
the doorway, one is inclined to hold one’s
breath from sheer surprise; for St. David’s
Cathedral is “all glorious within,” and there
is nothing outside to prepare one for the
Norman arches with their varied and rich
ornament, for the splendour of the fifteenth-century
roof, and of the rood-screen that
Gower built and is buried in. For nearly
two hundred years the nave was covered
with whitewash, and indeed it has narrowly
escaped worse things at the hands of evil
men, for Bishop Barlow, of whom we heard
at Lamphey, and heard nothing good, was
minded to strip the roof of its lead, and
was only stopped in this enterprise by
Henry VIII. It was this same bishop who
stripped the roof of Gower’s palace and so
led to its decay; and being, it seems, a
veritable <i>esprit fort</i>, he not only was the
first Protestant bishop who took advantage
of the permission to marry, but he also took
advantage of the dissolution of nunneries
and married an abbess. Their five daughters,
it is said, all married bishops. Barlow posi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>tively
hated St. David’s. Why, he asked,
should money be spent on these ruinous
buildings “to nourish clattering conventicles
of barbarous rural persons”? Why not move
the see to Carmarthen, since St. David’s was
“in such a desolate angle, and in so rare a
frequented place, except of vagabond pilgrims”?
The Saint himself was merely “an
antique gargle of idolatry.” In short, the lead
of the roof was the only valuable thing here.</p>

<p class="caption">ST. DAVID’S CATHEDRAL, INTERIOR.</p></div>

<p>Now Henry VIII., as we well know, had
little enough respect for the shrines of the
saints or for the beauties of architecture,
but he had a great respect for the bones of
his own grandfather&mdash;and these lay here.
So Barlow had to hold his hand; and we, as
we stand in the presbytery of the cathedral
beside Edmund Tudor’s tomb, must remember
all we owe to it. Nor is his the only notable
tomb in this place; for here is the simple
shrine before which so many kings, such
countless pilgrims, have knelt, and there is
the recumbent figure that some say is the
Lord Rhys, the son of the brave Gwenllian,
the greatest of the princes of South Wales,
of whom it was said that “his prowesse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
passed his manners, his wytte passed his
prowesse, his fayre speeche passed his wytte,
his good thewes passed his fayre speeche.”
Of the grave of Giraldus we must not be
too sure, for though it is pointed out to us
there has been much discussion with regard
to it. Yet somewhere in this cathedral his
dust lies we know.</p>

<p>Just beyond St. David’s is the sea. And
here too we must go, and, if possible, see
the sun setting behind that western horizon
where the hills of Holy Ireland are said to
be sometimes visible. St. Patrick saw them,
says the legend, as he sat on this shore,
and vowed to give his life to the conversion
of that land. He kept his vow; but William
Rufus, who stood here with very different
intentions, was less successful. As he looked
across the sea to Ireland, he said, “I will
summon hither all the ships of my realm,
and with them make a bridge to attack that
country.” His words were reported to Murchard,
Prince of Leinster, who, says the
story, paused awhile, and answered, “Did
the King add to this mighty threat, If God
please?” and being informed that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
made no mention of God in his speech, he
replied, “I fear not his coming.”</p>

<p>The legend that connects St. Patrick with
this shore is extremely circumstantial, but
whether it has the least foundation in truth
I do not know. In the Rosy Valley, says
the story, he built a college, where he taught
both boys and girls, and trained missionaries
who afterwards became Irish saints. One of
the girls was Nôn, the mother of St. David,
and it was near Porth Clais that that saint
was born. And when he was old enough
the boy too became a pupil of St. Patrick;
and so, when his college days at Llantwit
were over, and he was made “Archbishop
of Legions,” because “his life was a perfect
example of that goodness which by his
doctrine he taught,” he moved the see
from Caerleon to Menevia for love of his
master St. Patrick. In this way was fulfilled
the prophesy of Merlin: “Menevia shall put on
the pall of the City of Legions”; and from that
time forward Menevia has been called after
its first and most famous bishop, St. David.</p>

<p>From this strange, remote land of dreams
and legends and memories of early saints the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
transition to the world of modern progress
is rather sudden; for only fifteen miles lie
between the shrine of St. David and the new
turbine steamers of Fishguard. We shall
do well to choose the upper road, which
runs for the most part through a bare, inhospitable
land that is far more suggestive
of the remoteness of the village-city than
the most dramatic mountain pass could be.
Here and there we have a fine glimpse of
the coast, and there is a sudden softening
in the scenery as we draw near Goodwick.
Here, at one side of the pretty bay of Fishguard,
are all the evidences of the new route
to Ireland&mdash;the station, the hotel, and the
steamers at the quay, while across the bay,
beyond the long beach, the upper town of
Fishguard appears above the headland. Here,
at Fishguard, the French landed in 1797.
Then, as they looked at those heights above
the town, their hearts misgave them, for the
hills were ominously streaked and patched
with scarlet. It became plain to them that
a very large force&mdash;a far larger force than
they were prepared to meet&mdash;was waiting to
descend upon them. And so it happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
that their general, without loss of time, repaired
to the Royal Oak Inn, where he
signed his capitulation to Lord Cawdor. I
do not know when, if ever, he found out
that the masses of scarlet figures on the
hills were not soldiers, but the enterprising
matrons and maids of all the county round,
who had come out in the red cloaks that
were then part of the national dress, to see
what was going forward.</p>

<p>The lower town of Fishguard lies in a
cleft between two steep hills, and its pretty
little harbour has all the picturesqueness
that quays and boats and rippling green
water can give. The further hill of the two,
which we must climb, is of a most amazing
gradient&mdash;computed in contour-books as
averaging 1 in 7, but certainly 1 in 5 in
places. From the high ground to which it leads
us, lying between Fishguard and Newport,
there are glimpses from time to time of fine
coast scenery, and beyond Newport the road
lies through very pretty country, under the
conspicuous peak of Carningly. In the churchyard
at Nevern there is a beautiful Celtic
cross, the cross of St. Brynach, an Irish con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>temporary
of St. David. From this point the
road gradually rises to a considerable height,
and then runs down a long hill to Cardigan.</p>

<p>Cardigan, once “the lock and key of all
Wales,” gives us no hint of its former greatness.
It appears an uninteresting little town
till one realises that it is the Aberteifi whose
castle was taken and retaken, burnt, and
shattered, and built again, through all the
stormiest years of Welsh history; captured
by the men of the north from the men
of the south; defended by both against
the Anglo-Normans; attacked by the Flemings;
at one time the court of Llewelyn,
the greatest of the northern princes; and
at another the court of Lord Rhys, the
greatest of the southern princes. Here lived
Griffith, the father of Rhys, “the light and
the strength and the gentleness of the men
of the south,” whose brave wife, Gwenllian,
was killed by Maurice de Londres; and here
he and Gwenllian’s brother, the great Owen
Gwynedd, avenged her, when Cardigan bridge
broke under the retreating Normans, and
“the salt green wave of Teivy was clogged”
with the bodies of the slain. And here the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Lord Rhys held his famous revels, which included
one of those mediæval Tournaments
of Song with which Wagner has made us so
familiar. The invitations were sent out in
good time&mdash;a year and a day before the
event&mdash;and many hundreds of English and
Normans were bidden from “all Britain,
Ireland, and the islands adjacent.” The historian
goes on to tell us how “Rhys caused
all the bards or poets throughout all Wales
to come thither; and for a better diversion
to the company he provided chairs to be set
in the hall, in which the bards being seated,
they were to answer each other in rhyme,
and those that acquitted themselves most
handsomely and overcame the rest, were
promised great rewards and rich presents.”
And the men of Gwynedd won the prize
for poetry, but the men of the south were
victorious in music.</p>

<p>Such in the old days was Cardigan, where
the tourist may pause for a mid-day chop
or buy a picture postcard.</p>

<p>Two miles above Cardigan, on a crag beside
the Teify, are the ruined towers of Cilgerran,
which have been very little concerned with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
history, though they have stood here since
the days of Henry I. Their striking position
above the wooded banks of the river, however,
will repay us for a detour of a mile
or two, and we can rejoin the main road
at the beautiful bridge of Llechryd. Here,
where the prevailing note of the landscape
is peace, the gentle Teify, whose purling
waters have so often run red, was once
actually dammed&mdash;as on another occasion at
Cardigan&mdash;by the bodies of the slain, when
the princes of the south met the invading
princes of Powys and overthrew them.</p>

<p>From Llechryd we follow the Teify past
Newcastle Emlyn; and thence, if we like, we
may cross the moors to Lampeter; or, better
still, we may go straight on through the
Henllan woods to Llandyssil, a lovely little
place where fishermen delight to dwell, and
where in consequence there is a really charming
little hotel. And if, as may well happen,
there is no room for us there, we can after
all go on our way to Lampeter, for there also
there is quite a nice hotel, though of course it
lacks the charm of the country garden and the
rushing Teify. The moorland road between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Llandyssil and Lampeter is in its way unique,
for on both sides of it the hills are covered
with a thick, short growth of gorse, a carpet
of gold spread almost smoothly for miles.</p>

<p>At Lampeter there is nothing to detain
us but the important business of consulting
maps. For here is the parting of the ways.
If our object is merely to reach the English
border, our best way perhaps is to aim at
Builth. To do this we must strike across
the hills through lovely scenery; past Pumpsaint,
where George Borrow awoke to hear
the murmuring of the Cothi; through Llandovery,
where we have been before on the
way to Carmarthen; and thence over a really
fine pass to Llanwrtyd Wells. If, on the
other hand, we are aiming at North Wales
our obvious course is to strike across to
Aberaeron, and thence follow the coast to
Aberystwith and Barmouth. And if&mdash;and
this is the course I strongly recommend&mdash;we
intend to complete the circle, and end
our little tour by running down the Wye
Valley, then too we should make for Aberystwith,
and, turning thence eastward, join the
infant Wye on the slopes of Plynlimmon.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_VALLEY_OF_THE_WYE" id="THE_VALLEY_OF_THE_WYE">THE VALLEY OF THE WYE</a></h2>

<p>Those who have stout hearts and stout
boots may, I believe, discover the actual
source of the Wye among the rushes of
Plynlimmon. Five miles of hard walking
over rather dull downs will procure them
the satisfaction of seeing the first gleams of
the thin silver thread that is destined to
grow into the most beautiful river of England.
Most of us, however, will be content
to meet the Wye for the first time when it
is five miles old, so to speak, at the point
where it touches the high-road from Aberystwith
to Newtown. Even here it is a tiny
stream, rushing lightheartedly down the hill
over the rocks, unsobered as yet by the
dignified reflections of Hereford and Tintern
and Chepstow Castle.</p>

<p>These slopes of Plynlimmon are not particularly
inspiring, except when regarded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
the cradle of the Wye, and of that greater
river whose tributary she is, the Severn.
It is true that the standard of Wales, with
its red dragon, once floated victoriously on
the side of this hill, and the short grass has
been dyed with the blood of the Flemings,
who mustered here to chastise that stout
rebel, Owen Glyndwr, and were thoroughly
chastised by him instead. But in themselves
the heights of Plynlimmon are a little uninteresting.
Short grass and rushes are all
that grow upon them, and though their
rounded outlines have a dignity of their
own, the lack of colour makes them rather
desolate. It is not till the Wye has passed
Llangurig that it begins to earn its fame.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the Wye’s fame seems
to depend mainly on its lower reaches.
Nine people out of ten regard it as rising, so
to speak, in Hereford; the Upper Wye is
unknown to them and considered of no
account. Yet to those who know it the
Upper Wye, with its rugged hills and its
wealth of colours, has a stronger charm even
than the wooded loveliness of Symond’s Yat
or of Tintern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>At Llangurig&mdash;which is a wind-swept village
with a nice little inn and a reputation for
good fishing&mdash;the river and the road that
follows it turn sharply to the right, and begin
to descend by a very gentle gradient towards
Rhayader. The landscape changes gradually.
The hills lose their bleak desolation only to
become cultivated and commonplace: then
the fields yield to moorlands and the rounded
curves to bold and jagged rocks; and at last,
near the spot where the river Marteg adds
its waters to the Wye and the railway joins
the road, the great hills rise on each side
so precipitously that the way lies almost
through a defile. The hilltops are bare and
grey, but by the banks of the river is a belt
of trees; and as the valley widens the slopes
are no longer bare but are glorious in purple
and gold, in heather and gorse. And where
the flaming sides of the Elan Valley converge
with the valley of the Wye stands the tiny
town of Rhayader.</p>

<p>This is, I think, the gem of the Wye. It
is well, therefore, if possible, to stay here for
a day or two; and fortunately there is a nice
little hotel to stay in. There are hills near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
and far, and on every hill are all the colours
of the rainbow, and with the passing of every
cloud the colours move and change. Close
at hand are slopes of bracken topped by
rugged crags; far away the hills of the Elan
Valley are blue and amethyst. The river
rushes through the town, giving to it its
name of Rhayader Gwy, the Falls of the Wye,
though the falls are not what they once
were, I believe, before the bridge was built.
Of course there is a castle-mound, for no
Welsh town of a respectable age is complete
without one. The castle itself has disappeared.
The days of its life, indeed, appear
to have been few and evil. It was built by
“the Lord Rhys,” the mightiest of all the
princes of the south, but so strenuous was
the life of his day that he was obliged to
rebuild it a few years later. Afterwards he
was for a short time imprisoned by his own
sons, and it was while he was in this undignified
position that his castle of Rhayader
was seized by his enemies. But these dim
memories have lately been eclipsed. Those
who visit Rhayader to-day think little of the
valorous and potent prince of ancient Wales;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
they think almost exclusively of the Birmingham
Waterworks. We may forgive them for
this, for the Birmingham Waterworks are
more romantic than one would expect&mdash;romantic
not merely as all great engineering
works must be, with the romance of enterprise
and achievement, but also romantically
beautiful. One may drive for miles beside
the lakes that wind into the heart of the
mountains, and would have so natural an
air if it were not for their mighty dams of
Caban, and Pen-y-Garreg, and Craig Goch.
It is a drive worth taking, for the road is
good, the mountains tower above it with
real grandeur, and the waters have pathos
as well as beauty. The legend of buried
houses and churches is common to many
lakes; but in the case of the lakes of Cwm
Elan it is no legend, but a fact, that their
waters flow over the ground where generations
of men have lived and worked, have
ploughed their fields and said their prayers.
The affairs of most of them are forgotten
as completely as their houses are buried,
but there is one memory here that no waters
can hide&mdash;whether of Cwm Elan or of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
chilly Serpentine or of the blue Mediterranean&mdash;the
memory of Percy and Harriet Shelley.
They lived here once, young and happy, and
would have thought it a wild prophecy indeed
if it had been foretold to them that not
only they themselves, but even their quiet
homestead among the green fields, would be
destroyed by water.</p>

<p>From Rhayader to Newbridge the road
still closely follows the river, which, as we
watch it mile by mile, gradually becomes
wider and calmer. For the first few miles
the banks are wild enough, and very beautiful;
then suddenly the river is hidden from
us by the deep shades and countless stems
of Doldowlod Woods, where James Watt
once lived; and by the time we dart out
into the sunlight again we are nearing Newbridge.
On this road there is nothing to
limit our speed except the law, for from end
to end of the Wye the surface is good, and
there are no hills that deserve the name.
At Newbridge we leave the river for a few
miles, but join it again near Builth, and
cross it to enter that town.</p>

<p>Builth is unattractive. It professes to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
a Spa, but I never heard of any one who
drank the waters; and it is hardly likely to
become popular, since all the charms of
Llanwrtyd Wells are but thirteen miles away
on the one side, and all the fashion of Llandrindod
only seven miles away on the other.
Llanwrtyd is a delightful little place, with
a good hotel and lovely surroundings, unspoilt
as yet by popularity; while Llandrindod, as
every one knows, is beloved by so many that
it is no longer very lovable. Builth has little
to offer in rivalry of these, and indeed makes
small show of hospitality, maintaining in this
matter the character it earned long ago,
when it refused to admit its fugitive prince,
the last Llewelyn. It is only a little way
from here to the dell whither he struggled
through the snow from this his treacherous
town, only to find fresh treachery, and to
die through its means. His dust lies, they
say, at the spot called Cefn-y-Bedd, or the
Bank of the Grave; and here in quite recent
times a monument of stone has been set up.
It stands close to the wayside on the road
from Builth to Llanwrtyd.</p>

<p>This, however, is not our road, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
follows the Wye very closely for a time;
through Erwood, where from the top of a
slight rise we have a wide and beautiful
view; past Llyswen and the “Three Cocks,”
one of the most famous of fishing inns, and
through Glasbury to Hay. We are now in
a broad and fertile valley; the hills are
wooded; the river is growing slow and
stately in its demeanour. The whole aspect
of the country has changed, for at Hay we
shall leave all the wildness of Wales behind
us, and shall enter the quiet, homely county
of Hereford.</p>

<p>“I cam <i>in crepusculo</i> to the Hay,” says
Leland, and he chose his time wisely.</p>

<p>Hay, or La Haie, as it was originally called,
was once the meeting-ground of all those
turbulent mediæval passions that flourished
so exceedingly on the border. For this
reason it is full of ghosts. From this, the
Welsh side, it has rather an undistinguished
air, but when first seen by twilight from the
English side, with the Black Mountains
lowering behind it, and the remains of its
grim castle dominating it, little Hay seizes
the imagination. For those who approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
it thus <i>in crepusculo</i>, like Leland, the past
for ever lives in its commonplace streets
more insistently than the present; lives above
all in its castle&mdash;“the which sumetime hath
bene right stately”&mdash;the castle with the long,
picturesque flight of steps, and the longer
and still more picturesque history. Through
that great doorway many feet have passed
that never came out, for those that entered
the castle of Hay did it at their peril. The
greater part of the building as it now stands
is of Tudor date, but the entrance has by
some means survived since King John’s time,
and this in spite of difficulties: for the place
was plundered during the Border Wars,
destroyed by the Welsh themselves in self-defence,
rebuilt by Henry III., captured by
Llewelyn, retaken by Prince Edward, captured
once more by Llewelyn’s grandson, and
finally suffered the general fate of Welsh
castles. “Now being almost totally decay’d,”
says Camden, “it complains of the outrages
of that profligate Rebel, Owen Glyn Dowrdwy,
who in his March through these Countries
consumed it with fire.”</p>

<p>This last disaster may account for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
entirely modern appearance of the houses;
but there is nothing, no slate roof, no shop-window
full of cheap blouses, that can make
one forget the haunting presence of those
that walk unseen in Hay&mdash;the undying ghosts
of a hundred battles, murders, and sudden
deaths.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving Hay we pass the
remains of Clifford Castle. Here was born
Jane de Clifford, destined to be so fair that
men would call her the Rose of the World;
and here no doubt she played her childish
games on the banks of the Wye, with no
disturbing visions of that harder game which
she was to play later on and finally to lose.
The story of the avenging poison-cup is
untrue, we are told: it was in the nunnery
of Godstow that Fair Rosamund died, and
was buried beneath the cruellest epitaph,
surely, that was ever graven on a tomb.</p>

<p class="caption">HEREFORD.</p></div>

<p>Two miles beyond Clifford is the toll-bridge
of Whitney, and this we cross with a pretty
view of the river on each side of us. Our
way lies through Letton, past the turn to
Monnington&mdash;which claims to be the burial-place
of Owen Glyndwr&mdash;and through Bridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Sollars to Hereford. The landscape all the
way is characteristic of the country: a scene
of quiet fields and gentle river, of thatched
cottages and gay gardens. It is not exciting,
but it is extremely pleasant. Characteristic
as it is, however, it does not represent
Herefordshire at its best. The hills above
Ledbury, the hop-gardens round Leominster,
the woods and the wide views near Richard’s
Castle, are all more distinctive and more
beautiful than this part of the Wye Valley.
Indeed, if we were not at this moment
pledged to follow the Wye we should do
well to drive from Hay to Hereford by way
of the Golden Valley, though the journey
is considerably longer and the road by no
means so good. This valley was originally
named by the British, from the river that
runs through it, the Valley of the Dore, or of
the Water, for <i>water</i> is in Welsh <i>dwr</i>. The
Normans, jumping to conclusions, translated
this into <i>Val d’Or</i>, and so it became the
Golden Valley; “which name,” says Camden,
“It may well be thought to deserve, for its
golden, rich, and pleasant fertility.”</p>

<p>But it is improbable that either the fertility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
of the “Gilden Vale” or the remains of
Abbeydore Monastery will tempt a motorist
to leave the splendid road that will lead him
into Hereford by Letton, and Bridge Sollars,
and the White Cross that was set up in the
fourteenth century when the plague was
raging in Hereford, to mark the spot where
the infection ceased, and where, in consequence,
it was safe to hold a market. Here,
on the left, lies the suburb of Widemarsh
and beyond it the Racecourse, where the promising
youth who was afterwards Edward I.
showed at an early age that genius for
extremely practical jokes that he used at
the expense of the Welsh later on. He was
the prisoner of Simon de Montfort on this
occasion, and was taking a ride with a
certain number of attendants. He guilelessly
suggested that his guards should ride races
among themselves, while he amused himself
by looking on; then, when their horses were
tired, he upon his fresh one galloped off to
Dinmore Hill, where the Mortimers of Wigmore
were waiting for him. This incident
took place in Widemarsh; and in Widemarsh
too is a relic that is worth seeking out before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
we drive into the heart of the town&mdash;the
preaching-cross of the Dominicans, which,
with the ruins of a thirteenth-century
monastery, stands among the cabbages of
the Coningsby Hospital. The latter is an
Elizabethan foundation, and with the red
coats of its pensioners is in itself a picturesque
object in a town that is not very
rich in visible memorials of its great history.
We may look in vain for the castle that
was, according to Leland, the largest and
strongest in all England; the castle that
was repaired by King Harold and was once
so splendid with its ten wall-towers and great
keep; where Ranulph of Normandy stayed,
and Tostig, and King John, where John of
Gaunt was governor, were Simon de Montfort
imprisoned Prince Edward after the
Battle of Lewes, where Isabella proclaimed
her son Edward III. Protector of England,
and where Owen Tudor was a prisoner. As
it suffered no less than three sieges during
the Civil War, and when they were over its
remains were sold for £85, we need not be
surprised that the castle is now represented
by a public garden, where the youthful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
citizens of Hereford may play leap-frog over
the spot where kings have feasted and made
history. And not only has the castle disappeared,
but even of the old houses there
are very few remaining, as may be judged
by the name of the fine one that stands in
the principal street of the town. In Chester,
Worcester, or Shrewsbury, “The Old House”
would not be a very distinguishing name!</p>

<p>The chief point of interest in Hereford is,
of course, the Cathedral, with its long and
somewhat confusing history. An endless
number of people have had a hand in the
building of it, apparently, from the days
when Offa of Mercia enriched the shrine of
his murdered guest, Ethelbert of East Anglia,
till the quite recent and rather unfortunate
day when the west front was finished. The
consequence of this diversity of builders is
that Hereford Cathedral, with its austere
Norman south transept, its Early English
Lady-Chapel, its Decorated south choir-transept,
and its Perpendicular cloister, is
a complete Guide of Architecture.</p>

<p class="caption">ROSS FROM WILTON.</p></div>

<p>It was as the shrine of St. Ethelbert that it
first became important. There is a good deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
of disagreement on the subject of Ethelbert’s
death. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, for instance,
says <i>tout court</i> that in 792 Offa commanded
the head of King Ethelbert to be
cut off; whereas Matthew of Westminster
gives quite a different version of the affair,
completely exonerating Offa, “that most
noble and most illustrious and most high-born
king.” It was Offa’s queen, Quendritha,
he says, who caused a peculiarly comfortable
armchair to be placed in the bedroom of her
visitor the King of East Anglia, and beneath
it “a deep hole to be dug”&mdash;with very unpleasant
consequences for the visitor. When
the horrified Offa heard of Ethelbert’s fate
he shut himself up and refused food. “But,”
adds Matthew, “although he was quite innocent
of all participation in the King’s death,
he nevertheless sent a powerful expedition
and annexed the Kingdom of the East Angles
to his own dominions.”</p>

<p>The murdered guest, whoever his murderer,
was first buried at the spot still called St.
Ethelbert’s Well, and afterwards in Hereford
Cathedral, to its great enrichment.</p>

<p>There are several roads from Hereford to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Ross, none of which follow the river closely.
The most commonly used&mdash;being the least
hilly&mdash;is by Bridstow and Much Birch. Between
this road and the Wye are still to be
seen traces of the College of Llanfrother,
founded by Dubritius, that great Archbishop
of Caerleon who preached so movingly at
King Arthur’s coronation and then resigned
his see to the still greater St. David. On the
other side of the Wye is a shorter, but after
the first five or six miles a more hilly route,
with some fine backward views and some
glimpses of the river. The surface of this
road is all that can be desired, and the hills
are by no means formidable; but as one
approaches Ross the country is rather uninteresting.</p>

<p>Ross itself may be regarded as a monument
to one John Kyrle.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">“Rise, honest muse, and sing the Man of Ross! [cries Pope]</div>
<div class="i0">Whose causeway paves the vale with shady rows?</div>
<div class="i0">Whose seats the weary traveller repose?</div>
<div class="i0">Who taught that heaven-directed spire to rise?</div>
<div class="i0">‘The <i>Man of Ross</i>,’ each lisping babe replies.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The lisping babe, however, is making a mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>take,
for the Man of Ross only taught the spire
to rise forty-seven feet; and, moreover, it has
been destroyed by lightning and rebuilt since
his day (which was a very long day, lasting
from 1637 to 1724). “A small exaggeration
you must allow me as a poet,” said Pope.
But the fame of John Kyrle does not depend
upon the spire alone, for he did much to
improve the town, and did it, too, on a very
small income. “He was a very humble, good-natured
man ... of little or no literature,”
an eighteenth-century diarist says of him.
“His estate was £500 per ann., and no
more, with which he did wonders.” It was
not, however, by means of this modest estate
alone that he won his lasting fame as a
philanthropist, but also by untiring energy
and skill in the art of beggary, and the
judicious use of other men’s money. In the
case of the church bell it was his own money
that he used, and his own silver goblet also.
While the bell was in process of casting he
drank to Church and King, and then flung
the goblet into the molten metal&mdash;that after
serving for the sacred toast it might be for
ever consecrated to sacred uses. This incident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
adds a touch of the picturesque to the sterling
qualities of the benevolent old gentleman to
whom Ross owes its public walks, and the
<i>Prospect</i> that quaint Gilpin of the eighteenth
century described as “an amusing view.”
Ross repays him by keeping his name green.
It also&mdash;not entirely without difficulty&mdash;keeps
green the two elm-suckers that long ago
forced their way beneath the wall of the
church and rose (being elms of Ross) in the
pew of John Kyrle. They have been dead
for some time, but they are still draped carefully
with foliage to keep up the illusion.
The church itself is fairly old, and has some
interesting monuments, including an ugly one
tardily raised to the memory of the Man of
Ross.</p>

<p>In the town the most cherished relics are,
of course, Kyrle’s house and the carved monogram
he is supposed to have placed on the
outer wall of the Market Hall. The letters
“F.C.” are interlaced with a heart, and are
said to represent the words, “<i>Faithful to
Charles in heart</i>,” for Kyrle was devoted to
the Stuarts. Charles I. himself slept once in
this town, and other kings have visited it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
but none has distinguished himself here save
George IV. The Mayor of Ross sallied forth
to meet him, as mayors use, wreathed in
smiles and primed with speeches. By way
of response to all this loyalty and eloquence,
however, “the first gentleman in Europe”
merely pulled down the blinds of the carriage!
History does not record the mayor’s
next proceeding. The position strikes one as
difficult.</p>

<p>Close to Ross and on our way to Monmouth
is Wilton, which is reached by a beautiful and
ancient bridge of six arches, whence there is
a good view of Ross, clustered prettily on its
hill and surmounted by its heaven-directed
spire. Part of this bridge was broken down
during the Civil War to prevent Cromwell’s
army from reaching Hereford. The castle,
too, fell into the hands of the Royalists,
though its owner had carefully refrained
from supporting either side, with the result
that he offended both. The ruins now enclose
a private garden and are fairly picturesque
though they hardly compensate for an interrupted
run. Within these walls, of which so
very little is left, the poet Spenser was once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
entertained in the days of the Greys. Later
on the castle was owned by the family of
Brydges, one of whom, when he was Deputy-Lieutenant
of the Tower, was the means,
either deliberately or from mere procrastination,
of securing for England one of the most
glorious reigns in her history. The warrant
for the execution of Princess Elizabeth
reached the Tower, but Charles Brydges
delayed to carry it out. While he was
waiting Queen Mary died.</p>

<p>From Wilton to Monmouth the scenery
grows in beauty. At Goodrich Cross we
should turn sharply to the left to visit the
castle, and this is a matter that will take
some time. For in the first place the castle
is at some distance from the road, and in the
second place there is much to see, and much,
too, to hear. Yet there is little history connected
with Goodrich, considering its age and
dignity, and the great names of Pembroke
and Talbot that are bound up with it. Its
name, apparently is a corruption of <i>Godric</i>,
who built a fort here before the Conquest,
though the oldest part of the present ruin
is said to date from the twelfth century. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the Civil War it endured two sieges, and it
was after the second one, which lasted for five
months, that the Parliament dismantled it.
Except on this one dramatic occasion, Goodrich
figured little in public life. It is the
antiquary rather than the historian who will
find it of absorbing interest, for the arches
and Norman ornaments of the keep date from
Stephen’s reign, and many styles of architecture
are represented in the various galleries,
sallyports, and towers, which have been
gradually added by the successive owners of
the castle. Greatest of these was Talbot, first
Earl of Shrewsbury and hero of forty fights,
“a valiant man, of an invincible, unconquered
spirit.” He is said to have added a room to
the keep, whence he must often have seen,
as we may see, the Malvern Hills and the
Welsh mountains in the distance, with
Symond’s Yat and the Kymin nearer at
hand.</p>

<p>Below Goodrich is Huntsham Ferry, which
Henry IV. was in the act of crossing when
he heard of the birth of his son, afterwards
Henry V. So great was his excitement on
this occasion that he impulsively presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
the ferry and its profits to the ferryman,
whose heirs held this possession for generations.</p>

<p>About three miles from Goodrich we have
to climb a short hill with a gradient of
1 in 10; the steepest, I think, on this Wye
Valley road. From the top of it we run
down on an easy slope past the wall of
Wyaston Leys and through the woods behind
the Little Doward, with a beautiful
view&mdash;unfortunately visible only in glimpses&mdash;of
the winding river as it bends away towards
Symond’s Yat. At the foot of the hill we
enter Monmouth.</p>

<p>Now Monmouth, or some spot quite near
it, is without doubt the best motoring centre
on the Wye. The town itself is not so
pleasant to stay in as Ross or Tintern, where
there are hotels in pretty positions with nice
gardens; but to the motorist this is less
important than to others, since he will
probably spend the day on the road. The
important thing is to have a variety of
interesting roads upon which to spend it.
From Monmouth, one may drive up the Wye
to Goodrich, Hereford, and Hay; or down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the Wye to Tintern and Chepstow; or
through the Forest of Dean on the further
side of the river; or to Raglan, eight miles
away, and on to Abergavenny; or past Abergavenny
and the Holy Mountain into the
wild Vale of Ewyas to far Llanthony.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, there is goot men porn at
Monmouth,” says Fluellen, thinking of his
king; and it is of Harry of Monmouth that
we too think as we wake the echoes of his
birthplace with our horn&mdash;those echoes that
have so often answered to the “tucket” of
John of Gaunt and of many another. Some
say that it was John of Gaunt who built
the castle in which his grandson was born,
but whether this be the case or not there was
a castle on this spot long before his day,
though little seems to be known of it. The
probability is that John of Gaunt improved
and repaired the castle that was already
there. The existing building has had an
unusually chequered career even for a castle,
having been in turn a palace, a pig-stye, an
assize court, and a barrack. Even in James
I.’s time it was said “that his Majestie hath
one ancient castell, called Monmouth Castell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
... which is nowe and hath been for a long
time ruinous and in decaye, but by whom
it hath byn decayed wee knowe not, nor
to what value, in regarde it was before our
rememberment.” “Harry’s Window,” but
little else, survives as a shrine to the king
whose name is still “a name to conjure
with.” His statue stands on the town-hall,
but the bells of St. Mary’s are the best
memorial of Prince Hal, though their story
is more characteristic of the rollicking schoolboy
of Shakespeare than of the wise and
soldierly monarch of history. Time was
when these bells rang out over the town
of Calais. They were doing so when Harry
of Monmouth heard them first, and were, in
point of fact, celebrating his departure from
the shores of France with so much joyousness
that the demonstration seemed to him
to be carried too far. He vowed that they
should ring no more insolent peals in Calais,
and forthwith ordered them to be taken down
and carried to his native town.</p>

<p>His town has other memories than his, and
even other famous windows than “Harry’s.”
There is a fine oriel window, belonging now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
to a school, but carefully preserved in honour
of a twelfth-century archdeacon, who was
none other than that Geoffrey of Monmouth
whom Camden describes as “an Author well
skill’d in Antiquities, but, as it seems, not of
entire credit.” I fear there is little to be
said in defence of Geoffrey’s credit as a
historian, and there are those who say that
his window is no more authentic than his
writings.</p>

<p>Monmouth, like Hereford, is not rich in
relics. Of its defences, its walls and its four
gates, there is left only one gate on the
Monnow Bridge, but of this the foundations
are so old that there is no record of their
origin. The form of the gateway itself has
been slightly altered from time to time to
suit increasing traffic, but its picturesqueness
is uninjured. Through its arch we must pass
on our way to Raglan and Abergavenny and
Llanthony.</p>

<p>It is possible, of course, to see all these
places on the same day, but it is not desirable.
At Raglan one should have a leisured
mind, undisturbed by thoughts of space or
time or possible punctures. There are seats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
on its green terraces where one might sit
happily all day under the shadow of the
Yellow Tower of Gwent, seeing, not only
the straight, stern lines of the great citadel
rising from the moat, and the beautiful
windows beyond, and the machicolated
towers that flank the entrance, but also,
as clearly as these, the pageantry and
doughty deeds of long-dead but unforgotten
Somersets. Some of them lost their heads
in defence of the Rose of York, and some
lost theirs for the Rose of Lancaster, and
one, the most famous of all, lost the home
of his fathers in the cause of the thankless
Stuarts. Charles I. himself&mdash;for whose sake
all this splendour of banqueting-halls and
state-rooms and strong defences was made
a ruin&mdash;has stood upon this terrace and
looked up at the great keep to which he
was so fatal, has feasted in the Elizabethan
Hall, has ridden between the entrance-towers
in state, and has come to them for safety
as a fugitive. It was after the Battle of
Naseby that he fled for protection to the
house whose hospitalities he knew so well,
and whose owner, the first Marquis of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Worcester, had raised an army of two
thousand men to fight for the King. Somewhere,
in some dark corner within those
walls that were then so stately, Lord
Worcester met his ruined King by stealth,
and being aged and infirm was obliged to
call for help before he could kneel, as it
behoved him, before the fugitive. “Sire,”
said the old man weeping, “I have not a
thought in my heart that tends not to the
service of my God and you;” and he put
three hundred pounds into the royal hand
that took so much and gave so little. It
closed upon this gift, as it closed a few
days later upon the waistcoat that the Vicar
of Goodrich, Dean Swift’s grandfather, had
lined with Broad Pieces. There was one
occasion, it is true, when Charles feared
his entertainment might be too costly to
Lord Worcester, and suggested pleasantly
that supplies should be wrung from the
neighbouring peasants. But Worcester was
prouder than the King, “My castle would
not stand long,” he said, “if it leaned upon
the country.”</p>

<p class="caption">RAGLAN CASTLE, ENTRANCE TOWER.</p></div>

<p>Even as matters were, his castle did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
stand long. It held for the King till the
last barrel of powder was opened; but the
sad day came when the gallant old man of
eighty-five passed for the last time through
his own great gateway, between those warlike
towers that had fought their last fight.
He marched out to the sound of music and
with all the honours of war, but his heart
was broken, and after a short imprisonment
in the custody of Black Rod, he died. “When
I spoke with the man,” he said of his guardian,
“I found him a very civil gentleman, but I
saw no black rod.”</p>

<p>With this splendid old warrior the glory
of Raglan departed. Fairfax so dealt with
it that neither blood nor wine should ever
be spilt within its walls again; and the work
begun by him was finished by private enterprise.
It is said that twenty-three staircases
have been stolen from the ruins of Raglan.</p>

<p>About eight miles beyond Raglan is Abergavenny,
lying peacefully&mdash;forgetful of its
lurid past&mdash;in the shadow of the Holy
Mountain. There is about Abergavenny
now a peculiar serenity that is only equalled
by the darkness of its history. Not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
much is left of the Castle, of which Giraldus
Cambrensis, the historian, said that “it was
more dishonoured by treachery than any
other in Wales”; and what there is of it
is dishonoured now by swing-boats and
asphalt lawn-tennis courts. If these attractions
appeal to us we may enter the walls
by paying twopence; but in the twelfth
century the Seisyllts&mdash;the ancestors of the
Cecils&mdash;found that entering Abergavenny
Castle cost them more than this. One of
them, in the absence of the Norman lord
of the place, was having a friendly chat one
day with the constable. There was a part
of the wall that was in some way weaker
than the rest, and Seisyllt, pointing laughingly
to this spot, said in the manner of one who
jests, “We shall come in there to-night.”
The constable took the precaution of keeping
guard till daylight, then went to sleep. A
few hours later he and his wife were prisoners
and the castle was captured and burnt.</p>

<p>It was after this, I believe, when the castle
had been rebuilt, that the villain, William
de Braose, invited the princes of South Wales
to a banquet in these halls, picked a quarrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
with them at his own table, and had them
massacred before his eyes. He then solemnly
thanked God for the fortunate issue of the
affair, and more especially for the lands of
the dead Seisyllts. For this William de
Braose, traitor, murderer, and robber, never
forgot to be pious. “He always placed the
name of the Lord before his sentences,” says
Giraldus; and his letters “were loaded, or
rather honoured, with words expressive of
the divine indulgence, to a degree not only
tiresome to his scribe, but even to his
auditors; for as a reward to each of his
scribes for concluding his letters with the
words ‘by divine assistance’ he gave annually
a piece of gold.” In the matter of the murdered
Seisyllts, however, his thanksgiving
was premature, for there were Seisyllts still
alive who fell upon Abergavenny Castle and
demolished it.</p>

<p>It raised its head again and took an active
part in larger wars; but it adds little nowadays
to the attraction of Abergavenny, whose
charms are altogether those of peacefulness
and depend on the quiet Usk, and the hills
that grow so purple against the evening sky.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
To reach Llanthony we must drive on into
the heart of those hills, with the Skirrid Fawr,
or Holy Mountain, on the right and the Sugar
Loaf on the left; then, at Llanfihangel
Crucorney, turn sharply to the left down a
short but very steep hill, and so enter the
Vale of Ewyas. Soon after passing Cwmyoy
the road grows very narrow and hilly. At
Llanthony we can take our car into the
cloister-garth, for it is now the courtyard
of an inn.</p>

<p>Long ago, when Rufus was king, a horseman
drew rein here and looked about him.
On every side he saw the grand, clear outline
of the hills, and the shadows of the
clouds sweeping across the fern and heather,
and the dark masses of the woods. Below
him the little Honddu glittered among the
trees, and far away at the head of the
valley the heights of the Black Mountains
rose between him and the world. And then
and there he vowed that they should rise
between him and the world while he lived,
and should guard his grave when he was
dead. We can see the same hills at this
moment rising blue and misty behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
ruined towers of his Priory of Llanthony;
and only a few yards away, among the
grass and nettles, we can see the spot
where William de Lacy, soldier and monk,
was buried under the High Altar.</p>

<p>William de Lacy was not the first to
whom this valley appealed as being “truly
fitted for contemplation, a happy and
delightful spot”; for long before his day
this very place to which he had wandered
by chance had been made sacred by the
prayers of the greatest of all Welsh saints,
St. David. We may say our prayers on the
self-same spot to-day, for over there, just
beyond the cloister-garth, where St. David
had long before made himself a hermitage,
de Lacy built a tiny chapel. For many
centuries the richly endowed Priory has
been deserted, roofless, desecrated; its very
arches are fringed with weeds, and fowls
peck at its grass-grown altar steps; but over
there in that plain little grey stone building
prayers are still rising Sunday by Sunday
from the spot where St. David knelt alone.</p>

<p>Here in Llandewi Nanthodeni, or the
Church of St. David beside the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Honddu, William de Lacy “laid aside his
belt and girded himself with a rope;
instead of fine linen he covered himself
with haircloth, and instead of his soldier’s
robe he loaded himself with weighty iron.”
His solitude did not last long. In those
roystering days the sudden piety of a
soldier of noble birth was not likely to
pass unnoticed, and Matilda, Henry I.’s
Queen, whom William of Malmesbury
describes as singularly holy and by no
means despicable in point of beauty, came
to visit the hermit in his hill-bound cell,
and playfully dropped a large purse of gold
into the folds of his coarse garments. His
fame grew. Soon there were many who
desired to share his seclusion, and still
more who, while not quite seeing their
way to the forsaking of this world, were
anxious to show their interest in the next.
The former gave their lives and the latter
their money, and so Llanthony Priory rose
in all its grace and simplicity, the quiet
lines of its architecture in perfect harmony
with those of the great hills that encircled
it. “The whole treasure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
King and his kingdom,” said Henry I.’s
Prime Minister, “would not be sufficient to
build such a cloister.” The Court was
rather scandalised by this bold statement,
till the Prime Minister explained that “he
alluded to the cloister of mountains by
which this church is on every side surrounded.”</p>

<p>Giraldus describes the place as he saw it
in the twelfth century. “A situation truly
calculated for religion,” he says, “and more
adapted to canonical discipline than all the
monasteries of the British Isles.... Here
the monks, sitting in their cloisters enjoying
the fresh air, when they happen to
look up towards the horizon, behold the tops
of the mountains as it were touching the
heavens, and herds of wild deer feeding on
their summits.” It is probable that when
the Augustinians of Llanthony looked up
towards the horizon it was not altogether
for the pleasure of seeing the wild deer.
They had other reasons for taking an
interest in the hills, which too often were
swarming with the hostile Welsh. It was
not long, indeed, before the brethren’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
terror of the Welsh grew stronger than
their love of isolation, and the greater
number of them fled to Gloucester, where
in a new Priory of Llanthony their meditations
were undisturbed.</p>

<p>The beautiful valley, with its great, bare
hilltops and mysterious woods, its loneliness
and calm, its memories of saintly men,
attracted a poet of the last century so
strongly that he, like William de Lacy,
determined to stay here. Like de Lacy’s
monks, however, Walter Savage Landor
could not get on with his neighbours, and
after buying the ruins of the Priory and
building himself half a house he quarrelled
so thoroughly with all the countryside
that he thought he would have more peace
elsewhere. He lived in the rooms that
now form an inn, in the Prior’s Lodge, and
here Southey stayed with him.</p>

<p>This run from Monmouth to Llanthony
is about twenty-five miles in length. If we
are not wedded to the high-road we may
return to Monmouth by another route&mdash;composed
almost entirely of byways and
in some cases very hilly ones&mdash;and so visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Grosmont and Skenfrith Castles. The red
towers of Grosmont stand, as the name
implies, on a hill that is not climbed
without an effort, and the ruin overlooks a
village that was once a town, and indeed
is technically a town still. It still possesses
a charter, I believe, and a Mayor’s staff;
but in the matter of size and prosperity it
has been no more than a village since the
day when Henry V., then Prince of Wales,
wrote to his “most redoubted and most
sovereign lord and father” in his “most
humble manner” to this effect: “On
Wednesday the eleventh day of this present
month of March (1405) your rebels of the
parts of Glamorgan, Morgannoc, Usk,
Netherwent, and Overwent, were assembled
to the number of eight thousand men,
according to their own account; and they
went on the said Wednesday in the morning,
and burnt part of your town of
Grosmont ... and I immediately sent off
my very dear cousin, the Lord Talbot, and
the small body of my own household ...
who were but a very small force in all....
And there, by the aid of the Blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Trinity, your people gained the field and
vanquished all the said rebels, and slew of
them by fair account on the field on their
return from the chase, some say eight
hundred, and some say a thousand, being
questioned on pain of death. Nevertheless,
whether it were one or the other, on such
an account I would not contend.”</p>

<p>That was a sad day for poor Alice Scudamore,
who lived hard by at Kentchurch
Court beyond the river Monnow; for Alice
Scudamore, or Skydmore, was the daughter
of Owen Glyndwr, and the dead men whom
Prince Henry left upon the field of
Grosmont were Owen’s followers. This
defeat was Owen’s first serious disaster,
and was for him the beginning of the end.
It is said that years later, after the end
had come, he lived for a time with his
daughter in the castellated tower that still
stands below the hill of Grosmont; and,
indeed, Kentchurch sometimes claims to be
his burial-place. But the claims of Monnington,
where another of his daughters lived,
are generally thought to be more authentic.</p>

<p>By making a very short detour from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
direct road we may see the ruins of Skenfrith
Castle on our way back to Monmouth.
Even in the seventeenth century this castle
was described as having been “decayed
time out of the memory of man,” and its
remains are now naturally scanty and not
especially picturesque. Far more interesting
than the castle is the church, with its
pretty timbered tower and fine sixteenth-century
tombs. At the vicarage is carefully
preserved the rarest treasure of this
church: a cope that dates from the days
before the Reformation.</p>

<p>On the other side of Monmouth, beyond
the Wye, is the Forest of Dean, where one
may drive for miles through country nearly
as grand and quite as thickly wooded as
the Black Forest. In most cases the trees
are not nearly so fine as those of our own
New Forest, for the greater part of this
Forest of Dean was cut down to build our
victorious fleets of the eighteenth century;
but the width of view and the succession
of tree-clad hills rising one beyond another,
are compensations for the lack of magnificent
individual trees. Of these, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
there are a few, such as the Newland Oak
and the High Beeches. But on the whole
the beauty of Dean Forest lies in its distant
views, its great expanses of foliage
stretching away from one’s feet to the blue
horizon, as at the Speech House and above
Parkend, and at many another place;
though unfortunately many of these views
are partly, if not entirely, spoilt by the
black scars and smoking chimneys of the
collieries. The Speech House is now a
hotel, but it was originally built in
Charles II.’s day as a kind of Court House
in which to settle disputes connected with
the Forest. St. Briavel’s Castle, a few
miles further south than this, and nearer
the Wye, is a far older relic, for it is said
that it once sheltered King John. Be that
as it may, the little that is left of this castle
is peculiarly attractive. To reach it, or the
Speech House, or indeed to drive in the
Forest of Dean at all, one must be prepared
to encounter long hills with gradients in
some places not less than 1 in 7, and roads
that have suffered a good deal from the
heavy traffic connected with the mines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>There is one expedition from Monmouth
that we cannot possibly undertake in a
car, yet should by no means omit. The
famous Symond’s Yat, with its perfect river
scenery, cannot be approached by road, but
it is easy to reach it by train, and very
delightful to return to Monmouth by water,
past the great limestone crags known as
the Seven Sisters. At the hotel, where the
train deposits one, the attraction is simply
the view of the river and its wooded
banks, but for the energetic this view may
be much enlarged by half an hour’s climb
to the summit of the Yat itself, where
those who enjoy scenery in proportion to
the number of counties visible, may have
the satisfaction of seeing seven. It was
near Symond’s Yat, at a defile significantly
called The Slaughter to this day, that the
Danes, under Eric of the Bloody Axe, were
defeated by King Alfred’s son Edward the
Elder, named also the Unconquered, whom
Matthew of Westminster declares to have
been “even more glorious than his father
for power and dignity.”</p>

<p>The last fifteen miles of the Wye Valley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
from Monmouth to Chepstow, where the
Wye falls into the estuary of the Severn, are
probably as beautiful as any fifteen miles
of English road. It is late in May or early
in October that we should drive along this
road to see it at its best, for the whole
landscape is filled with trees. The quiet
river, with the road close beside it, winds
between two wooded heights from Redbrook
to the Severn. A gentle rise takes us out
of Redbrook, which has spoilt its beauty
by manufacturing tin-plate; then we run
down to Bigsweir Bridge, and cross it, with
a lovely view downstream; pass Llandogo,
where the Wye becomes tidal; pass Brockweir
with its ferry; and driving through
Tintern Parva come within sight of the
unsurpassed beauty of Tintern Abbey.</p>

<p>Go to Tintern again and again, for it
never palls. See it when the trees are first
breaking into leaf, and all the leaves are
of different colours; and see it again
against the heavy foliage of the summer
woods; and again when the hills behind
it are red and gold in autumn. For the
Cistercians, though they denied art, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
surely admirable artists; and being forbidden
by their stern rule to adorn their churches
with coloured glass or superfluous carving,
they raised for themselves buildings of
perfect form in the loveliest places in all
England, where in spring and autumn the
cold grey stone of their exquisite windows
was the frame of fairer colours than were
ever stained on glass.</p>

<p>It was of this abbey that the incomparable
Gilpin wrote quite gravely: “A number
of gable-ends hurt the eye with their regularity
and disgust it by the vulgarity of
their shape.” A mallet, judiciously used,
he suggested, might make improvements.
Unfortunately time and long neglect have
done only too much towards the ruin of
Tintern, without any help from the judicious
mallet of Gilpin. For many years the
place was utterly uncared for; the stones
were used by any one who wished to build
a cottage, and an old beggar-woman made
her dwelling in the library of the monks.
This was long ago: every care is given to
Tintern now. The floor of the nave is
covered with well-kept turf, the fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
fragments of masonry are gathered together,
the weak places of the building are strengthened
wherever it is possible. But the
alarming curves of the arches bear witness
to past neglect, and the timid tourist is
appalled by the ominous warning on the
notice-board: “Persons who visit this Abbey
do so at their own risk.” This is discouraging.</p>

<p class="caption">CHEPSTOW CASTLE.</p></div>

<p>From Tintern the road rises for about
three miles towards the splendid scenery
of the Wyndcliff. The river winds below,
and beyond it among the trees a discerning
eye may detect the straight ridge of Offa’s
Dyke. The view from the road as it passes
beneath the famous cliff is wonderfully
beautiful&mdash;a view of tortuous river and
height beyond height of woodland, and
gleaming in the distance the waters of
the Severn estuary: and those who climb
the Wyndcliff come down again well contented,
having seen nine counties.</p>

<p>As we pass the little village at St. Arvan’s
the river is completely hidden by the walls
and trees of Piercefield Park. A gentle
descent of about two miles brings us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
the steep hill that winds downwards into
Chepstow above the castle, passing under
one of the old town-gates.</p>

<p>“The towne of Chepstow hath bene very
strongly waulled,” says Leland. “The waulles
began at the ende of the great bridge over
Wy, and so cam to the castel, the which
yet standeth fayr and strong.” To all
appearances, as seen from the further side
of Wye, it is strong still, and fair it certainly
is, standing high upon the red cliffs
that add so much to the beauty of this
last bend of the river. It covers three
acres of ground, but as it is built in a
succession of courts, sloping upwards one
above the other, the whole of its great
length may be seen at once and the effect
is very fine. This castle, since it was built
by William FitzOsborne, Earl of Hereford,
soon after the Conquest, has seen a good
deal of life, and even more of death. Its
second owner forfeited it, being of too independent
a temperament to please the King.
William, having safely imprisoned this
rebellious Roger, sent him as an Easter
gift his own royal robes&mdash;an attention that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
was meant well, but was not very tactful.
Earl Roger “forthwith caused a great fire
to be made, and the mantle, the inner surcoat
of silk, and the upper garment, lined
with precious furs, to be suddenly burnt.”
This was his last act of rebellion. “By
the brightness of God,” exclaimed the flouted
King, “he shall never come out of prison
as long as I live!”</p>

<p>Later on the castle passed to the great
house of Clare.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">“From Chepstow’s towers, ere dawn of morn,</div>
<div class="i0">Was heard afar the bugle-horn;</div>
<div class="i0">And forth in banded pomp and pride</div>
<div class="i0">Stout Clare and fiery Neville ride.”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The greatest of the Clares, Richard Strongbow,
sometimes called the Conqueror of
Ireland, was born at Chepstow; “a man tall
in stature,” we are told, “and of great generosity,
and courteous manner.... In time of
peace he was more disposed to be led by
others than to command,” but “the post he
occupied in battle was a sure rallying-point
for his troops.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>The castle passed from hand to hand
through the stirring centuries that followed
Strongbow’s day. In the Civil War it had
many adventures. It held for the King at
first, was taken by the army of the Parliament,
and was recaptured by a handful
of Royalists under Sir Nicholas Kemys, by
guile rather than by force. “On the whole,”
says Carlyle, “Cromwell will have to go....
Let him march swiftly!” He marched swiftly
and took the town of Chepstow, but besieged
the castle in vain. Carlyle tells the tale in
few words: “Castle will not surrender,&mdash;he
leaves Colonel Ewer to do the Castle; who,
after four weeks, does it.” It was not easily,
however, that Colonel Ewer “did it.” The
garrison, reduced to nineteen, held out till
they were starving, and even then determined,
not on surrender, but on flight. Their
boat lay ready beneath the walls, waiting
for the darkness. But when night came no
boat was there, for a soldier of the Parliament,
a man of keen eyes, had detected
both the boat and her object, and, with a
knife between his teeth, had swum across
the Wye and cut the rope that moored her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
to the river-bank. The next day the nineteen
Royalists surrendered. Thus Colonel
Ewer “did the castle.”</p>

<p>During the Commonwealth Jeremy Taylor,
the author of “Holy Living and Holy Dying”&mdash;according
to Coleridge the most eloquent
of divines&mdash;was imprisoned in Chepstow
Castle as a follower of Archbishop Laud:
and here, too, when Cromwell’s day was
over, Sir Henry Marten, the regicide, suffered
a mild form of imprisonment for
twenty years. He was allowed not only to
receive his friends but to visit them, and he
was not deprived of the companionship of
his wife. From what I read, however, I
cannot assure myself that he appreciated
the last of these privileges. He was buried
in Chepstow Church, under an epitaph that
he composed himself&mdash;a rhyming epitaph of
a high moral tone. Yet neither poetry nor
morality was Marten’s strong point. At a
later date a loyalist vicar removed from
the chancel to the nave the bones of the
man who had signed Charles I.’s death-warrant.</p>

<p>Chepstow Church once formed part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
a Benedictine Priory connected with the
Norman Abbey of Cormeilles, and was originally
the nave of a larger building. It dates
from early in the twelfth century; and even
if one has not time to enter the church it
is well worth while to drive past the beautiful
Early Norman entrance. There are
some interesting tombs within, notably that
of the second Earl of Worcester, who was
present at the Field of the Cloth of Gold.</p>

<p>Two miles south of Chepstow is Mathern,
where Tewdric of Glamorganshire, saint and
king, was buried. He was killed in a battle
fought at Tintern, and in the year 600 a
chapel was built here as a shrine for him.</p>

<p>“Wye also,” says Leland, “a very great
and famose river, passeth through Ventland,
and at S. Tereudake’s Chapel entereth ynto
Severn.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
